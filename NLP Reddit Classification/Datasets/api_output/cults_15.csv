I never officially joined the Nation Of Islam, however I came close.  I had been going to the Monday night meetings and attempted to write a letter that was necessary for joining.  The letter was rejected over and over, so I said, ""This is a sign that this isn't for me.""  I still went to the NOI Sunday morning meetings which overtime just became nauseating with the same old stuff, no progress as it pertained to black people, homophobia, and reactionary ideas of 50s morality.  I sadly joined the SGI pseudo-Buddhist cult at age 25.  

I first heard of SGI in during the  2013 October Pride.  By this time I had been chanting on my own for some  months.  I picked up that booklet *The Winning Life*.   I read the book front and back, but it didn't motivate me to join.  I  reached out to Nichiren Buddhist communities on Facebook and that's how I  ended up  in contact with a SGI member.  I went to my first  introduction to Buddhism meeting with a MD in January 2014.  On the way,  I was put off by him saying that everyone was chanting to become happy.   After the opening chanting, I told the man I  had to study Biology.  I  did, but I also wanted to get out of there.  The MD gave me a *World Tribune* to read. I never read it.  It reminded me too much of the NOI's *Final Call*.

Summer  2014: I researched Soka Gakkai by way of Wikipedia, as I hadn't heard  of Reddit yet.  So far, what I had read was glowing, but I still wasn't  convinced to join.

Affixing breakthroughs to SGI activities

August  2015: I had a financial aid problem in college.  Chanting and doing  Gongyo wasn't working.  Then I had went to a study meeting, imbibed the  concepts and little by little the problem resolved.  I connected the  resolution of the problem to chanting, and doing activities.

September 2015 First seed of doubt:

This is from the September 2015 *Living Buddhism* pages 60-61.

""If   members persevere with strong faith to the very end, they will be   victorious, even if they should die from illness.  There are many who,   while suffering from illness, have chanted for kosen-rufu and the   happiness of others, and continued to reach out to encourage those   around them right up to the very moment of death.  Their lives and their   bravery in the face of death have given courage and inspiration to   countless others.  Such people will quickly be reborn with healthy   bodies.  I knew a young girl who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at age   11 and died at 14.  But throughout her illness, she was always happy   and bright.  She even cheered up the adults in the hospital with her   sunny, positive presence.  No doubt her illness caused her terrible   pain, but she continued to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and to encourage   others.  When she was near death, she said to one of her last visitors:   'I don't care about my illness anymore.  I've stopped chanting for   myself.  There are so many others worse off than me.  I'm chanting with   all my heart that they will take faith as soon as possible and find out   for themselves just how wonderful the Gohonzon is.'  To her parents,  she  said brightly: 'What if this had happened to you, Dad?  We'd be in   terrible trouble!  And it would be just as bad if it had happened to   you, Mom.  And if it had happened to my little brother, I'm sure he   wouldn't have been able to handle it.  I'm glad that it happened to me   instead of any of you... I'm sure this is the result of a promise I made   before I was born.  If my life can somehow touch and inspire those who   know me, I will be happy.'  Hearing this girl's struggle with illness,  I  sent her a bouquet of roses.  I also sent her a Japanese poem on  which I  had written the words ""Light of happiness"" and a photograph I  had taken  of a field of irises in bloom.  I heard that she was thrilled  when she  received them.  To those around her, she left the words  'Faith means to  continue to believe until the very end.'  And she  demonstrated those  words with her own life.  At her funeral, a long  line of people came to  pay their respects.  In her brief 14 years, she  had told over a thousand  people of the greatness of the Mystic Law. She  won.  That's what I  believe.  Everything that happened to her had  meaning.  Or rather,  through her struggle, she gave meaning to her  suffering.  She said that  her illness was the result of a promise she  had made in her past  lifetime."" ""...If those who embrace the Mystic Law  were blessed with  every form of happiness from the start, no one would  ever come to know  how powerful and effective Nichiren Buddhism is.   That's why we  voluntarily choose to be born with problems and suffering  so that we can  show others what human revolution looks like.  It is as  if we are  performing a part in a play, a great drama.""  That did not inspire me one iota.

November 2015: I began to imbibe the  concept of esho funi (oneness of self and environment) into my life.  I began to use that concept to  change my relationships with people.  By that I meant that I had  determined to change myself so my life would improve, family would  improve, and finances would improve.  My evenings between November 2015  and January 2016 were spent kind of like this

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8mdbHrWi38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8mdbHrWi38) starting at 0:34 time stamp.

\*There  is nothing wrong with taking responsibility for any way you are  contributing to your own distress.  The problem arises when you try to  take responsibility for things beyond your control.  You cannot control  the weather.  You cannot control your reality.  You cannot control how  people feel about you; no matter how long you chant for their happiness.   There are people who will dislike you no matter how nice and  respectful you are, or make an effort to be.  When that happens, the  problem has *nothing* to do with you.  I am telling you this now to spare you a catastrophic meltdown.\*

Also  I began to shakubuku people on my campus,  and in my hometown  community.  I had really imbibed the message of shakubuku being the  fastest way to change karma.

\* For those who may wonder how could an erudite person get sucked into such a cult,  assess these factors

* Generational indigence
* Substance abuse within family
* Domestic abuse within family
* Tempestuous familial relationships
* Had a difficult time making long-lasting friendships until my early mid-20s
* Bullying
* Social isolation
* Emotional isolation for the first 23 years
* Homophobia (internalized and external)
* Heteronormative inculcation
* Parental abuse
* Parental emotional neglect
* Difficulty fitting in except for at college

Sadly, no amount of book smarts can offset the deleterious effects of these factors.\*

2016: Now I initially wasn't totally  gung ho even as a member.  Yes I did shakubuku, but I told people about  nam myoho renge kyo and Nichiren more than about SGI and Daisaku Ikeda.   In 2016, my activity participation frequency increased slightly more.   As it related to Gajokai, I treated it like every now and then community  service.

September 2016: The  study format for Gosho study had changed.  There was no longer a Gosho  passage and Ikeda's lecture on certain passages.  It was now, 95%  Ikeda's lectures, and 5% Gosho snippets.  And I am being *very*  graceful with that percentage. Anyway, it paled in comparison to the  way it was when I first joined; it paled in comparison to the 2007-2010  editions of *Living Buddhism;* it paled in comparison to the 2005 editions of *Living Buddhism*.  I know this because as a lover of vintage things, I would read and collect old *Living* *Buddhism* editions from the past.  I worked around such a disappointing turn of events by reading the Gosho on my own time.

Fall  2016: This is when I first heard of the 50K initiative.  Personally I  wasn't on board with it.  I still remember being gung ho for Nation Of  Islam's 2005 Millions More Movement initiative and being so disappointed  when it ended only four years later.

Early  2017: I accepted a YMD district leadership position.  I only did it  really to fill in a quota because I was tired of the leadership gaps  within my district.  By gap, I mean that there was a WD leader, MD  leader, and a YWD who was MIA.  (In hindsight, good for her).

 August-October 2017:  By this time, I had used chanting to release a lot  of anger.  Now, I was gung ho for SGI.     Then I started to really see  fanatical behavior, and the regimentation.  I  was doing shakubuku with  a WD member from the NSA days.  She was trying  to push me to make  friends with one person I had shared nam myoho renge  kyo with. When I  told it took time for me to make friends with people,  she said, ""You  need to make friends more quickly.""    For months  to come, she would  ask me if I got in contact with that young man which  was a no.  Also,  that summer I had increased my Gongyo recitation to 3-5 times a day  since I couldn't chant up to four hours a day.  I was so happy to tell  her that.  I considered it splendid given that there were YD, even in  leadership positions, who still struggled with doing Gongyo twice a day.   To my dismay, she was not happy with that.  Even when I explained my  reasons.  The topic ended with her saying, ""Then you are not practicing  with the SGI.""  This was also in the same dialogue where she told me  about a woman who left the SGI and her house burned down.  Almost two  years later as I was defecting, I gave her a piece of my mind about  that.  Later on that month, I had a financial aid crisis.  Also, I had  neighbors with whom I didn't have a particularly good relationship with.   Along  with the practical scholarship search method, and the respect  the boundaries method, I also, handled it the SGI  way: chant like your  hair is on fire for 60+ minutes, shakubuku like  it's the NSA days,  participate in Soka Gakkai activities, and receive  some encouragement,  which boiled down to: think positive and don't  doubt.  I shakubuku'ed  x&gt;200 students.  Long story short, it didn't  keep me from losing my  enrollment and dorm housing; nor did it improve the relationship with  those neighbors.     I had to live under  a clandestine arrangement, however I was just   determined to have  legitimate housing.  So many nights, I was in study  rooms chanting and  furiously rubbing my beads together like a stark  raving madman; and I  participated in Soka Gakkai activities with the  hopes of accruing enough  good fortune to turn my condition around.  I  did it in spite of  inconvenience, and preference.  I participated in a  Soka Spirit toso  with the same WD and her MD husband knowing all I had  to eat for  breakfast was a cookie, which was insufficient.  Some weeks  later, I went to another district's district  discussion meeting with  her husband, and at his behest, I read the  lyrics to the god-awful song  ""I Seek Sensei"". 

 November 2017: I also lost a friend, who was a SGI member.  He had HIV  and died from AIDS complications.  I was devastated and baffled.   I  wondered, ""Sensei was told he wouldn't live past 30 due to   tuberculosis; and he's been defying the odds for six decades.  This was   supposedly due to his practice and efforts for kosen rufu.  My friend   had been dealing with HIV for over a decade and died three years after   becoming a member of the SGI.  Why?""   Later on that month, this Many    Treasures member asked me to do an experience.  I told her I  didn't  have   an experience.  Instead of finding someone else, she  encouraged  me to   use an ongoing struggle as an experience of  determination.  She  said   that it would encourage others.  So I did it.     It was a T.B.  C. experience.  A T.B.C. experience is a To   Be  Continued experience  where there is no victory given at the end,    rather it's a  re-determination to win.    I don't know who the hell   got encouraged  by my TBC experience but I  sure as hell didn't.  I hate   cliffhangers.   It's one of the reasons I  hate to watch the last  episodes  of *Moesha* and *Supah Ninjas.*   Also, normally when I gave experiences, I considered if I would be  convinced if it was coming from someone else.  With that being said,  I  am not encouraged because someone is continuing to  fight.   It sticks  in my craw that I gave this galling experience.   I  refuse to put my  hat in a losing battle.  That's just a waste of my   time and energy.   When I gave that TBC experience, it just created more   anxiety for me  because then I had to find a way to win, but since I was   told to put  more goals into the experience, I had to find a way to   accomplish  those too.  It was unnecessary stress. 

 December 2017:  I wasn't seeing eye to eye with my mother at the time  and trying to  find a place in the area, especially in order to make it  to the last  meeting of the year.    I had been told that making it to  the meeting would allow me to accrue good fortune.  However my apartment  was a day late.   The only place I could have went in the city was the  homeless shelter.   The MD  who was to drive me to my new apartment  dropped me off at the  homeless shelter.  Even if bunking with him would  have been a tall  order, he could have either had me lodge with someone  else, or just  dropped me off at the shuttle and said, ""I'm sorry you  can't make it.   Just get on the bus and go back home.  See you in  2018.""  Not drop me  off at a homeless shelter.  (Update: my mother and I  are doing better.  She was rightfully mad as hell when she found out  about me being in a  shelter).  The homeless shelter was terrible, *especially*  given that the hosts had terrible bedside manners.  The day afterwards I  had decided that if my room wasn't ready still, I was going to go back  home.  It turned out, my room was ready and I  was able to go to the  December 16 meeting.  Afterwards, I learned that  my room had bedbugs. I  had bites on my neck and arms.  I had to go to  the emergency room and  wait all  night for a prescription.  To the  couple's credit, they did  take me to Walmart and foot the bill for my  prescriptions.  But now, I  still have a $749 medical bill to pay from  that night.   Make no  mistake, I also studied the Gosho and President Ikeda's  writings.  But  frankly, President Ikeda's words just rang hollow as he  said a life  without problems would be empty and uneventful, and that  enduring and  overcoming difficulties are true ""peace and comfort"" .

 Early 2018:  I am convinced that the only way *anyone*  can still exhibit that SGI ardor after experiencing what I experienced  in 2017, they would have to either be under the influence, delusional,  or flat out attempting to distract themselves like Brad Nixon in *Bladfold*.   I was in essence going through the motions.   In  the months leading  up to the 50K Lions of Justice Festival, I had to   call YMD in my  district to try to motivate them to register.  Most of   the YMD in my  district had been MIA (Missing In Action) since before I   became a  member.  (Basically 12+ months MIA).  My personal rule is  this:  if  someone has not made an effort to surface or reach out, then  they  are  no interested in being a part of the SGI.  Anyone who was no  longer   interested in being a part of the SGI, I was willing to respect  their   decisions.  (Even as a member I had the mindset ""this is not a one  size   fits all"".) I felt so intrusive and disrespectful calling these  men  upon  orders from higher up.  I felt so terrible that when my higher  up  leader  suggested that we call throughout the week, I rebelled.  I   didn't call  at all.  Around this time, I was discouraged from goalless  chanting by a MD.  This quote by the late Marie Fredrikkson of Roxette  sums it up: ""  I was sad a lot of the time ... when I  always had to be  nice and say  the right things, always having to be  available to  everybody, always  putting on a smile and being happy...  I had less and  less space to be  myself. And when I was myself I felt uncertain, small  and lost.""  Besides, during this period, I was trying to revive my faith. 

 Summer 2018:  After graduation, I lived with my mom, maternal uncle, and  maternal grandparents.   The events of 2017 wrecked my self-confidence  and ravaged my faith in a way synonymous as an EF5 going through a  trailer park.  On top of that, living in my maternal grandparents' house  was a nightmare.  There was no central air so the heat was unbearable;  my uncle was, and likely still is, so disgruntled and would at random  moments take it out on my mom, maternal grandmother, and eventually me;  my maternal grandmother has dementia and would periodically throw her  weight around; I had no money; all of my friends lived hours away.   I  was so desperate to revive my faith that I bought *all* of the volumes of *The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra*  and a book of Ikeda's poetry, which is terrible.    In the end, all of  the studying failed to revive my faith.  No amount of study could  convince me that all of the hoops and drama that I had went through in  2017 was worth it.  Also, reading *The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra Volume 6* is how I learned of the late Junko Kobayashi (1949-06/26/1982). 

\*Junko Kobayashi:

She  had joined the Soka Gakkai in 1966 three months after her parents.   Three years after they joined, her mother died from cancer (so around  1969-1970).  Her father died shortly thereafter.  I only kept my  malcontent to myself.  Daisaku Ikeda gave her this encouragement after  the death of her father, ""For someone your age, the death of a parent is  something that you would expect to experience twice in the future.  So  really all that has happened is that you have experienced this somewhat  earlier than others.  But because you have the Gohonzon, everything will  be all right!""  Kobayashi exerted herself to the utmost in practice and  Soka Gakkai activities.  She was apparently able to even study abroad  in Spain.Two years later, a malignant tumor was discovered in her left  knee.  She underwent surgery, relearned to walk, and worked tirelessly  for kosen rufu in Spain.  In 1982, the cancer had metastisized in her  lungs and she died at the age of 32.  Remember when I said that she *exerted* herself.  Fuck a million, she did *20,000,000*  Daimoku from the time she first went to Spain, even in the terminal  stage of her cancer.  Here is some math for you in SGI terms:

10,000 Daimoku at galloping horse rhythm = 3 hours

20,000,000 Daimoku at galloping horse rhythm = 6,000 hours (250 days)

Now  while I understand that illness and death are inevitable, I expected  with this practice, for my life span would be extended to at least my  80s.\*

 By August, thanks to my mother's urging, I sought out employment, or  underemployment.  Then I started to practice consistently.  Up until  then, I would go days without doing Gongyo.  This time, when I started  practicing consistently, I resumed goalless chanting.  I also told my  mom that after 50K I was done with SGI due to the Ikeda focus.  I also,  as a result of Google surfing, stumbled upon this subreddit.  Here I  learned of the late Shin Yatomi who had died from lung cancer in 2007. 

 August 2018: Around this time, 50K rehearsals were to begin.  That  involved a huge carpool, thanks to the members.  I was in chorus.  The  first thing that put me off was the frenetic chanting during morning and  evening (well afternoon) Gongyo.  The first time dealing with that was  so terrible that I went a week without doing Gongyo because every time I  attempted, I would hear that frenetic chanting in my ear.  One weekend I  missed rehearsals because the first day I had ride issues.  The second  day, I didn't want to risk that again.  So instead, I went to my  zadankai.   MD who was taking me back home from zadankai told me that I  should have  stayed in the city and fought for the success of 50K, even  if it meant  being homeless because that's how one builds good fortune.   When I tried to explain what happened in 2017, he blamed me for my  struggle.  He told me that it was because I tried to make a deal with  the Gohonzon.  The only reason I didn't say anything was because I  didn't want to get kicked out mid-trip.  I wasn't going to risk  homelessness again.   The MD also encouraged me to pass out 50K flyers,  which I did out of desperation for a change in my estate.  I  accidentally sent it to someone who initially turned down my shakubuku  and that ended that contact. 

 September 2018:   Leading up to 50K, I assisted with vocal warm ups.   Since the music  involved using augmented second leaps for one verse and  a whole minor  seventh leap, I incorporated them into the warm ups.   (Thank you Hanon  No. 12). I really enjoyed that.  What I didn't enjoy  was studying excerpts from *The New Human Revolution*  or the regimentation where every YD, unless sick, was to participate in  Gongyo.  I worked around it by studying Gosho more so than Ikeda's  literature.  I practically treated Gosho like reading letters sent to  me.  It was almost like Celie from *The Color Purple*  reading letters from her sister Nettie.  Also, a WD assured me that I  could chant at my own pace.  So while everyone else was chanting like we  were riding out a 7.3 earthquake, I was chanting in a more slowly and  relaxed.   On the weekend before the festival, Southeast Region and  South Central  Region practiced together in a high school knowing that  on this day in  question (Saturday), the school's air conditioning was  malfunctioning.   Now the temperature outside was 90+ degrees  Fahrenheit.  It would have  been plausible to cut rehearsals short or  relocate, but no.  Three of us  got sick, including myself.  I had a  headache and nausea.  I felt  better the next day; and I got to miss  that closing Gongyo.  I heard  someone say that the Saturday closing  Gongyo was the best group Gongyo  session ever.  I am glad I missed it.  And after 50K, nothing really changed in my life.  Absolutely nothing.   My faith wasn't revived after 2017.  If ever asked if I would ever  participate in another event like 50K again, my answer would be no.  Absolutely not.   The one thing that turned me off at the festival were  the experiences  where Daisaku Ikeda was mentioned.  I did not join the  SGI to take part  in his approbation.   The ultimate takeaway from the  whole experience was this"" in the spirit  of itai doshin (many in body  one in mind), we will ameliorate our world  via doing our human  revolution in the name of esho funi (when you  change, the environment  changes). Everything was ultimately about Ikeda. 

 March 3, 2019 (My last KRG):  Leading up to March 3, meteorologists had  been discussing the chance for  severe storms for March 3, 2019 with a  chance for severe thunderstorms,  damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes.   The area I was living in at the  time since May 2018 was initially under  a Slight Risk for severe  weather. On March 3, the area was moved up to  Enhanced Risk.  I had a  concern about my grandparents' house, that I  was living in, being rocked  by a significant tornado, (EF2 or higher),  especially since it was old,  falling apart,and the foundation had been  corroded by chalk from a  nearby plant for over 45 years.  All I could  think, ""I have to get out  of here.  This house can't take an EF2.""  (An EF2 is a strong tornado capable of snapping or uprooting even large trees, tossing cars, and on the high end can toss 18-wheelers, demolishing mobile homes, tearing roofs and exterior walls off houses, turning light objects into impaling missiles, and apparently as seen in Rutherford County, Tennessee, can flip an unanchored house onto its roof).   So I was *not*  willing to find  out what that would possibly do to my house.  Given that  March 3, 2019  fell on a Sunday, there were no other businesses open in  the county,  and barely any business was open in the nearby counties.  So  I offered  to do a Gajokai shift at the kaikan nearly two hours away.  I  didn't  have a set way back home.  The only thing I could think about  was  getting out of a potentially life-threatening situation.  I own that   what I did was imprudent; I risked being stranded; and I inconvenienced   members who were kind enough to give me a ride back.  I of course was   upbraided for it.  I was sure to apologize and reimburse them as much as   I could.    Now I know that the SGI  would have been to trust the Gohonzon and ride  out whatever storm came.   After 2017, my attitude to that was hell no.  After 2017, that was *never*  happening again.   When you chant to live in the best place possible,  and the Gohonzon  has you supposedly going from a homeless shelter to a  bedbug-infested,  overly priced hovel, are you going to trust it to  protect you, or trust  it to have you ejected to your possible death?   Now thankfully my  house, and the neighborhood was unscathed in the midst  of two EF1s that  struck within 40 miles.  In total, on that day, over  40 tornadoes  touched down within that state, and the neighboring states.   It was  indeed a tornado outbreak.  The outbreak spawned an EF4, the  first  violent tornado the USA ever had in nearly two years, and that EF4   resulted in a death toll the USA has not seen since the 2013 Moore,   Oklahoma EF5. 

 Also, at that KRG, I talked to a Many Treasures member who spent two  years homeless and yet telling people that through chanting they could  get anything they wanted.  That sounds mortifying. 2 years; 24 months;  104 weeks; 730 days; 17,520 hours; 1,051,200 minutes; 63,072,000 seconds  of not knowing where you are going to sleep night after night; of  watching your fellow members, the people you shakubuku, including the  people you encouraged to trust the Gohonzon, leave your presence and to  houses while you hope you can get a spot at the shelter and *not*  have to sleep on asphalt; and yet telling people that they can get  anything they want via chanting.  Even if the spring eventually came,  was it really worth that level of humiliation?  In my case in 2017, it  wasn't. 

June 2019: By this time, I had just  given up on changing my family karma.  Also, I began to redefine myself  with a better perspective.  While I still identified myself as a  practicing Buddhist, SGI took a backseat me being a Buddhist and a  musician.  Also I was ready to leave SGI, but I didn't want to say, ""The  Gohonzon failed me"" because members could use that to say that I had  weak faith. If you don't believe me, assess these quotes:

""  Shin’ichi went on to say that the  secret to happiness was winning over   oneself and practising to the  Gohonzon with doubt-free faith that  flows  like a pure stream, no matter  what happens.

'The  Daishonin’s   Buddhism is made valid,” he said, “by documentary,  theoretical and   actual proof. But some people begin to have doubts as  soon as their   business suffers a little downturn, or say the Gohonzon  has failed to   protect them if, for instance, their child gets injured.  And there are   those who, when certain sectors of the mass media  criticize the Soka   Gakkai, begin to doubt the guidance of their  seniors in the Gakkai, lose   faith in the Gohonzon, and stop doing  gongyo altogether.

'These   are  people who tend not to reflect on themselves or their faith.   Instead,  whenever the slightest problem or setback occurs, they start   doubting  the Gohonzon or the Soka Gakkai. However, this only erases the   great  benefit they would have otherwise accumulated. 

'Babies   thrive because they drink  their mother’s milk without question. If  they  stop drinking it too  soon, however, their growth will be stunted  and  they’ll become weak  and susceptible to illness. In the same way, if  we  continue to have  faith in the Gohonzon and chant daimoku throughout  our  lives, we will  absolutely tap into the life force of the Buddha  and the  way we live  will reflect a condition of absolute happiness.

'Please   do not doubt the Gohonzon, but continue to chant daimoku and  work   together with the Soka Gakkai, the organization dedicated to    kosen-rufu. This is the way to enjoy a truly meaningful and happy life.”    Shin’ichi’s guidance expressed his earnest wish that each of his   fellow  members would enjoy a life of great fulfilment, abundant benefit   and  good fortune. '""

— ‘Pure Stream’, *New Human Revolution Volume 8*, 192–93

""Although I and my disciples may  encounter various difficulties, if we do no harbor doubts in our hearts,  we will as a matter of course attain Buddahood.  Do not have doubts  simply because heaven does not lend you protection. Do not be  discouraged because you do not enjoy an easy and secure existence in  this life.  This is what I have taught my disciples morning and evening,  and yet they begin to harbor doubts and abandon their faith.  Foolish  men are likely to forget the promises they have made when the crucial  moment comes."" WND-1, 283

Also, I  was talking with a MD from a SGI Facebook group and he brought up Nikko  Shonin's 26 Admonitions.  I realized that I disagreed with No. 21.

[http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/](http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/)

No.  21:   You should not sit together with slanderers of the Law  at  religious ceremonies for fear of suffering the same punishment as  they.

July 2019: Someone asked this question in the SGI Facebook group:  **I   am new to this practice. I am  also interested in Zen Buddhism. I  would  like to practice  both. Do  you think either would object ? Does  anyone  also practice both ?** I was okay with it.  Others  weren't.  I was so hard pressed not to say, ""Fuck what Nichiren says?""   And in the midst of an argument, I realized that I had my reason to  leave.

Now having read the  articles on the subreddit, I knew I had to be strategic with it; lest I  get pulled back in.  So I told my non-SGI friends about my defection.  I  didn't tell anyone in SGI for two weeks, howbeit given my exit  experience, I would suggest waiting 2-3 months before notifying.

The  first two weeks were actually great knowing that I was done with SGI.   When I finally got around to letting SGI members know that I was done, I  1. highlighted that I was leaving due to doctrinal disagreements 2.   Framed the defecting as I was leaving the Fuji tradition of Nichiren  Buddhism. (By Fuji tradition, that included the following schools:

* Nichiren Shoshu
* Shoshinkai
* Kenshokai
* Hokkeko)

My rationale for that was so no one  could say that I left SGI for Nichiren Shoshu, especially with 2020  being the 30th anniversary of Daisaku Ikeda beginning his lecture series  at Soka University, and 2021 will be the 30th anniversary of Ikeda and  Akiya being excommunicated from Nichiren Shoshu.(Soka Gakkai and SGI  were not really excommunicated in 1991.  Here is some proof.  Volumes of  *The Major Writings of Nichiren Daishonin,*  the Gosho edition that Nichiren Shoshu use to this day, were still  printed by NSIC (Nichiren Shoshu International Centre) and distributed  among Soka Gakkai and SGI until 1995.  Now why would Nichiren Shoshu  distribute its edition of the Gosho to a group that it already  excommunicated?  Given how quiet it is compared to SGI and Soka Gakkai,  it's not likely to be motivated as much by greed.)

Rationally speaking, if you don't believe  in the crux of a religion, there is no point in you staying whatsoever.

Or so I thought

The   closest friend I had made in the SGI, and had known for four years,   couldn't accept it.  When he found out through the SGI grapevine that I   was defecting, he called me.  Even after I read to him the article  which  *really* upset me.  It  upset me  because he was a fortune baby with a bachelor's in Sociology,  and the  admonitions are easily accessed under the Soka Spirit website.

[http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/](http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/)

If he didn't know, he could have used Google to find out.

Nevertheless   he set up a call meeting with a WD.  This was the same one who told me   to give that TBC experience.  This WD just lied to me like a corpse in  a  ravine.  Just lied to tell me what I would want to hear so I would   stay.  This is why SGI cannot be a force for change in the world.  It's  so attached to membership numbers that it will practically undermine  Nikko's doctrine, which Soka spirit is supposedly based on, in order to  keep members from leaving.  At the end of the call, that young man said,  ""Sensei says no  one who has left the SGI has ever found happiness.""

I did some myself. And I had occasion to hire a lot of models for photos and video shoots related to media advertising, printed materials (including fashion catalogues and glitzy real estate brochures), infomercials and other videos. 

Most of what *I* ran into would not fit into the criteria of the BITE Model or any of the others in [this article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html). But as one got closer to the Very Big *Fashion* Leagues -- as well as the porn industry -- one began to see a *lot* of high-demand, high-control, highly manipulative, saddle-up-the-pony-and-ride-it-with-the-whip-until-it-collapses dynamics one sees around such as the Church of Scientology and the entire est / Forum / Landmark cascade. 

I saw quite a few photo and video shoots that lasted from arrival for makeup at 6:00 a.m. to bar closing time. In those days, strong coffee, Coca Cola, Mountain Dew and nose-job cocaine were pretty commonly used to keep the models and the crews on a roll (more or less as in the 1997 feature film ""[Boogie Nights](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=boogie+nights+movie)""). Since then, motivational enhancements have also included anti-depressants, Rock Star, Monster, Red Bull, Ecstasy (Molly), crystal meth and crack TIKO. 

Agents and management at such as Elite, Ford, IMG and DNA have often been accused of running their (mostly adolescent) models like jockeys in the Derby, though the mostly well-heeled parents -- and their attorneys -- are wise enough now to prevent the sort of abuse that was more common years ago. In the *fashion* universe, at least.

But not so much in bare skin world... until recently. (The Internet and the age of laptops with video cameras has changed *everything*. The models are far more ofetn in charge of their own destiny in 2020.)

Back in the 1970s and '80s, however, a single agency called World Modeling on Van Nuys Boulevard in El Lay's San Fernando Valley controlled access to the lion's share of ""pretty girl,"" soft- and hard-core porn models in what was -- until fairly recently, and for the reason noted above -- a *very* substantial industry in SoCal. The very recently departed [Jim South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_South) was the soft-spoken, ostensibly easy-going, trust-inspiring face at WMA. But behind the scenes, the faces were a whole other thing. Bikers for sure, possibly Angels? IDK. But I do know that bikers and white slavers running white sex workers cozied up real nice everywhere from Bakersfield to Waycross in those days. 

I also found myself moonlighting in the paste-up room at Larry &amp; Althea Flynt's *Hustler* magazine while a g/f was doing her thing on camera there and elsewhere. Larry was pretty loosey-goosey, but Althea ran a very tight ship (like any madame who winds up well off). Having interviewed several former SeaOrg'ers who did time at the [CoS](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=church+of+scientology)'s Gold Base out in Hemet, however, I was struck by the similarities: For a workplace full of *sex*, everything was oddly rigid and antiseptic. Even, well, *tight-assed*. 

In retrospect, was I seeing the middle levels of a [Cultic Pyramid](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) in action there and (through my girlfriend's eyes) at the Hefner mansion? I'm not sure. But I can say that I spent enough time around a good half dozen of the ""regulars"" on the Playboy Channel's ""Electric Blue"" to get a sense of them as modeling *clay* in the hands of their various employers. 

While relatively accurate in many respects, ""Boogie Nights"" did *not* -- IMO -- show the sort of ""dead-eyed zombie"" look I saw on the faces of some (not all) of those girls. One thing was for sure, however: Every one of them had been [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology&amp;oq=social+construction+of+reality&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.7012j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)ed, [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), [imprinted]( https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_3784), habituated and [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) to a) a sort of us-vs.-them ""we're special"" exclusivity typical of cults and b) an attitude about sex and romance that was far closer to what middle- and upper-class millennials display now than what was typical at that time. 

And those attitudes did as much to separate then from their families and make them dependent upon each other, their agents and their hourly wage employers as has been the case at the GB and the Landmark office. 

Those girls would be 58 to 64 now, btw. I knew several into their 30s. They all looked pretty ""high mileage"" by then, and every single one had drug abuse problems and relationship difficulties. I also got to know a former, *highly* successful,  fashion-model-turned-TV-spokesperson who wound up the very same way. 

Moreover, many of them -- my girlfriend at [LFP](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=larry+flynt+publications) included -- became so addicted to cocaine that they fried themselves and either lost or gained so much weight they were no longer ""shootable,"" And were summarily wadded up and tossed in the proverbial dumpster... rather like what happened to *so* many at the Gold Base years later, and around the Landmark Forum headquarters in San Francisco at about the same time.

Angel Billings 1991 - 2020

Angel (Aaron) Billings was a gentle and talented musician, whose song was silenced on  August 21, 2020 at the age of 29 in West Valley, UT.    She was a beautiful and creative soul, though her life was plagued by physical and mental illness and childhood trauma caused by her upbringing within an abusive Mormon Fundamentalist Cult.  At the age of 22 she managed to escape that oppressive situation in 2013.  Though completely destitute and without adequate preparation to brave the world alone,  she persevered, and managed to work out her own medical relief and gainful employment, though only by living out of her car.  It's unclear whether the car fire was accidental, or by the pressure of her mounting trauma she took her own life.  What is clear is that she would never have been in that situation, had she been raised by compassionate parents in an emotionally stable situation.

Aaron chose the name 'Angel' when she came-out as trans-gendered recently, this is yet another thing her second-rate dick-tator father would never have tolerated, so it was 'closeted' for years.   

Angel is survived by an asshole cult-leader father and a mother who was his plural wife unwilling to challenge the authority of her husband to help her son, even in the most desperate circumstances.  She is also survived by over 50 full and half-siblings equally brainwashed by their narcissist father.  May they one day be free.

We will miss you Angel, and cherish our collective memories of your unique beauty and your music forever...

""Cohen recalled meeting only two fully enlightened people, both Indians. None of Cohen’s students have become liberated. To be sure, he said, many have had brief awakenings; some had insights so strong that they wanted to become teachers in their own right. But Cohen helped them to see that their desire to leave Andrew and become independent teachers stemmed from pride.

I could not let this pass. I pointed out that Cohen himself has said that he became fully liberated only after dissolving his relationship with his guru, Poonjaji. Shouldn’t he help his students achieve independence from him? Cohen shook his head. He reminded me that Poonjaji was imperfect; if you find a truly enlightened, perfect teacher, there is no reason to leave him.

""Let's say the Buddha was alive today. Let's say someone that great, that enlightened, that pure, that perfect, with such a great teaching, was still alive. I mean, could someone be too attached to someone like that?""

Yes, I replied. I did not see how you could be truly liberated while remaining dependent upon another human, even one as great as the Buddha.

But one cannot be too dependent upon a truly enlightened person, Cohen said, exasperated. ""The more attached you get to a person like that, the more free, literally, you become."" Cohen derided the importance that people in general, and westerners in particular, give to independence. He had begun slapping the table to emphasize points. ""Look,"" he said forcefully. ""Anybody""—Slap!—""who wants to be free is going to have to bend his knee."" The mind ""must surrender!"" Slap! ""However that happens, it doesn't really matter, as long as it happens."" Liberation cannot occur until the ego, the ""root of all evil,"" is obliterated.""

Andrew Cohen's organisation later collapsed and several books were published criticising him.
He was interviewed in a documentary that subsequently disappeared but it's reportedly being made into a film. 

Here's a video on how he has interpreted the collapse:

Now he has started teaching again and you can see his current outlook on things here:

Greetings r/cults,

Podcast promo here! We’ve been lurking around this sub for a while now, and have found this community to be extremely fascinating &amp; helpful for our research, but have been hesitant to self-promote for a long time. Well, we’re finally posting here after nearly two years of doing the show, so hopefully if you decide to listen, you’ll find us entertaining or interesting or at least distracting :)

Because of the format of our show- grey area between cult or not- some of our topics are much more or less “cultier” than others; I’ll list a few of our popular ones below.

If you’d like to reply to this thread, would love to hear your feedback.

Also how I needed to get advice on everything from where to live, who to live with and what job I should take. It was exhausting!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t feel free or alive in Christ. I felt chained. I found myself dreading going to meetings, and bring so tired of it. This wasn&amp;#39;t how faith was supposed to look like to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad was getting very sick with cancer and had numerous ops and I didn&amp;#39;t have the energy to go to meetings and work in the city. I started using sex as outlet to escape from this. I was not proud and was so confused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was very close with my dad, he raised me.My dad and my mum always thought the Icoc was exclusive and didn&amp;#39;t like it. My parents never came to church. The year before he died I left the church. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 6 months since he passed and I am grieving and trying to work out how to get close to God again and what to look for in a church. My identity for so long was as an icoc disiciple. I am trying to work out what Christianity is to be now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions are welcome. I also have a partner now, he is great and doesn&amp;#39;t know I was in a cult. We share everything but I want him to meet my friends from the Icoc without a view of &amp;quot;those are cult people&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The majority of my support network is icoc. I have 2 friends from &amp;quot;the world&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s really tough and I am starting a master&amp;#39;s soon in psychology to go and help people like me grieve and support those with poor mental health.  Thanks all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear others stories!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'excoc', 'subreddit_id': 't5_310lg', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/excoc', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1277, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'UK excoc and trying to navigate faith and icoc ""doctrine""!', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/excoc/comments/io7hbc/uk_excoc_and_trying_to_navigate_faith_and_icoc/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'wls': 0}]",

The first CULT believes that minorities don't deserve rights, women deserve (very) slightly more, incite corruption in local government, and mass murders are discouraged but not punished.  


The second CULT demands high tribute from its followers, their leadership is much more disorganized than the first. They say that they treat women better, but still take advantage of them often, and they are \*very\* sensitive.  


And the scariest part is that you probably participated in their CULT, somehow, to some extent.

I'll go over some basics because sometimes religions can seem like cults and that is unfair to ridicule them that way, but there are cults that use religion as a basic uniting principal.

For one, chanting is more cult like than prayer. It is designed to create a euphoric happy feeling amongst the group. There might even be religious prayer intertwined, but the consensus is the chanting tends to be short phrases repeated over and over, while prayer has a centralized view around a particular person or diety. So, someone can pray to the virgin Mary and say a Hale Mary.
But chanting ""give us your milk"" over and over and then claiming to be talking about The mother's milk of the virgin Mary, is more of an indication of manipulation and cult like tactics.

Maybe people have better examples they would like to share.

The other aspects of cults is how they ask for support, and just like church they might want a donation, but there is a difference between a modest donation and someone signing over heirlooms and property to a church organization.

Cults also keep people apart from their families and sometimes become very controlling of their members when they want to leave. They might refuse to let them move on and reunite with family without some sort of backlash.

Beware of gangs and criminals because they are types of cults really. They methodically devalue the family support of people and entail that they owe their group or gang over a variety of political interests. 
Beware if you ever go to jail because bondsman are often a product of this behavior and it becomes all to easy to be taken advantage of over a night in jail.

Cults also tend to have no central existence. There's no center for them to identify as, like Christian or Jesuit, or Jewish or Mormon. They are secret and can exist inside many different organizations and in politics. In fact, sometimes it is like mainstream society to name the cult as they become identified, especially in cases of kidnapping and entrapment.
Cults would rather remain a secret.

A bunch of hippies in the wilderness holding charity events is rarely a concern for cult behavior although they might fit stereotypes of cults past.

Newer cults are more advanced and utilize technology as an interface. They may not even involve religion to the extent.  They want to actually keep and retain wealth as a secret group underneath the surface of everyday functions and aquisitions in the mainstream.

&amp;#x200B;

so I knew someone a while back who was getting quite involved with a personal development course based on Jungian psychoanalysis, particularly relating to the Jungian theory of archetypes.

&amp;#x200B;

It involves workshops and mens circles, not really my kind of thing. But it struck me as a bit suspect when I noticed that on an advertisment for a workshop he was doing, he was claiming to be a 'therapist in Jungian psychology' which sounded a bit too close to calling himself a psychotherapist, which he most certainly is not. He doesn't have any academic qualifications. Even worse, he hasn't even read any Jung (or he started to read one book but couldn't continue because it was too hard reading).

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gather, he has been to a few workshops and now has a title from the organisation so he can do his own workshops and also life-coaching online, which he gets paid minimum wage for, and I guess most of the money is going to the organisation.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know exactly what these workshops involve - probably lots of glorified hokey-pokey routines and group sharing, but I guess with a 'psychological' approach. He seemed to have modelled his personality around this programme, a personality which seemed quite fake and cringey. He also talked about being on a mission to raise the conciousness of mankind.

&amp;#x200B;

So the idea I was getting was that this programme is trying to be a Landmark-type-thing, with the pay-to-be-a-trainer-then-make-money-for-me financial model.

&amp;#x200B;

I will say that it certainly didn't seem as harmful as EST, so perhaps a lite version of that.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, this is the webpage for the group in question https://www.inner- [throne.com/](https://throne.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

As you see, lots of weird jargon, the claim that it gives better results than modern psychology in just 1 hour, mapping the archetypes to the shape of a pyramid...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not saying this is a cult (but maybe it could be the beginnings of one)...

&amp;#x200B;

But it got me interested in Jungianism as a new-religious-movement. After some research it seems that Jung is a pretty controversial figure.

I noted a book from the 90s called 'The Jung Cult' in which a researcher claims that Jungian Psychoanlysis was behind-th-scenes a new religious movement with Jung believing himself to be a reincarnation of one of Mithras(?), and other themes related to the mystery religions of ancient rome. (I didn't actually read the book, but I read an interview with the author which laid out a lot of the claims and evidence for it).

&amp;#x200B;

I was given this name in a dream. I had an   experience in a county mental hospital that haunts me to this day.

In   june, i was sent to a county mental hospital. I prefer to keep the   location to myself, as at times i feel like they keep tabs on me. I was   sent there once after \*some\* sort of crime escalated in my house... i   dont know what happen exactly but police were called, called again, and   then i was deemed ""mentally unstable"" because whatever had happened  that  day really shook me. they threw me in this county hospital for no   reason other than that i was smarter than they were about what  happened.  This hospital was hell, i mean literally hell. I've been to  numerous  ones but this was like prison. The food was shit, dog shit.  They were  going to close soon, after years of being open, and so were  running out  of the dog shit food they served. They starved us by  drugging the juice,  making us pass out immediately and forget we hadnt  been served meals. I  lost about 20 pounds my second (also meaningless)  time i was there. i  had suspected that they may have these dart gun  type things they drugged  us with as well, but i am unsure. I just  remember feel a WHACK and BOOM  im out for hours.

Later   on in my first stay, i ran into the same person that had caused the   trouble at my house, in this same hospital. I was so scared he would end   me. I remember there was a man who worked there, they called him  satan.  I remember he was the only god that worked there. He had strange   ""horns"" that came from his head, and when he walked, it was more like a   leap. he also fascinated me, the way he fought demons and spirits. he   looked to have max stats. For whatever reason, that person i had   recognized from early also had some sort of role in this hospital. he   worked with that ""satan"" guy to try to end me. i was left on life   support for a while, that i remember. But I am a strong man, see, and i   have visions. I saw the face of a god, and i fell. But i always come   back, but i feel as though they killed me there, then put me in some   sort of first responder/virtual reality game to see if i could tell who   did it to me. I always get back up when i fall, i have a strong spirit.   But no, my spirit is gone now, i know part of me died in that  hospital. I  feel as though i have a mental foe, always following me. I  got my chips  and soda too, because i know The Truth. They put me in  some sort of  time machine there, and said, ""Icarus, you have dropped  your Staff. You  must die now.""

I   also have flashbacks of being shot with rubber bullets, and it feels as   though they are reappearing in my body now, in the present, because i   went through the Time Machine. They would also needlessly put us in   restraints, make us fight each other, and also remember some vague   sexual trauma. Like the (female) guards would dress up in attractive   attire, drop their bluetooth earbud, and then have sex with me and say,   blue eyes, you cant leave early, thats cheating!

I   remember being in the restraints, and they would say ""you can be   released from them if you guess \*this\* number on the door x feet away   from you. I am extremely psychic, you see. So they would test my powers,   and i could guess the door number correctly a few times, but not  every.  I also have a very good intuition on when the world will end,  which is  what somewhat attracts me to reddit. I think the minute they  put me in  that Time Machine i knew in my heart the world would end.

Lately   ive dealt with possession, it is very hard being psychic in these   times. The spirits just flow in and out of me. They bring me back, they   keep me alive in away.

I  have  wondered many times if they micro chipped my left ear, i have seen  cars  drop these EMP type of things around me. When they do drop them,  my  left ear rings, like i feel the blast in a way. Please someone  confirm  this for me! it is very confusing!

I   also see these dark figures on street corners, they look as though  they  training for something. I wonder if those are the demons that  haunt me.  That man, satan, with max stats, they surround him.

I   fear that foe will find me one day, that is why i wrote this. I do not   fear him, i am brave now, but i crave answers. Please, hear my story.

So my mother found this ""guru"" guy on youtube who talks about our pagan religion that was persecuted. I myself follow that ""religion "" but the stuff this man is saying is off. He claimed that he was god (and we know a clear sign of a cult is claiming divinity), or like that our god is ""talking"" to him and telling him what to do.the thing is in our belief, that god does NOT talk to us not even the highest level shaman can talk to him so I'm already put off by him. He says a lot of other stuff and pretty much sh**s on other religions gods, saying their dead and stuff and that non believers are going to die cause they dont follow this ""religion"" since their god is already... dead. And that our people will lead the ""path"" to spiritual evolution and paradise. He even said that he was the one who sent the Corona virus and that he set up a ""protection barrier "" around our country to prevent the virus getting here.
Not only that, he's quoting HITLER as proof of the stuff hes saying and i DONT understand how that didnt raise a red flag in my mothers head.

So obviously I dont like him. At first it was just her watching his videos everyday but then she started parroting the stuff he says and saying hateful things that I dont think she even realises. She wont listen to me even tho I keep pointing out his inconsistencies that dont aligne with our belief. But now shes TALKING to him, shes on face call talking to him and I eavesdropped a bit and he was getting her sympathy talking about how people ridicule him and stuff and shes over here uplifting him and telling him how great his message and videos are and all that. Him sorta emotionally manipulating my mother like that seriously put me off as well. He hasn't asked for money or anything like that from what I know but a few days ago my mother asked my father for money pretty aggressively and didnt tell him what it is for so I'm just a bit worried about her possibly sneaking him money.

And what's concerning is that she wants to teach that stuff to my little brother, I wouldnt mind teaching him our belief but the stuff she wants to teach him is nothing more than a hateful and dogmatic version of our belief. Its twisted to the point that I might just become atheist again lol

Another thing, in our belief we have multiple deities and one is for earth her name is ""jer"" and shes a high ranking deity, but that man is completly disrespecting her saying that shes not ""jer"" but that god instead, hes teaching stuff that goes completly against our beliefs and not only disrespecting other religions but also our own deities. 
I had the liberty of not having anything forced onto me, I was even atheist for a large chunk of my life and I just wanted to reconnect with my ancestors beliefs but I dont want anything forced onto my brother. I want him to have that freedom to choose as well and I really dont mind teaching him the beliefs of our ancestors but I'm worried since she wants to teach him what that man preaches. She never interfered in my beliefs before and that allowed me explore freely, but now all of a sudden she really wants to convert my brother into this as well.

Another thing I found is that hes tried running for president 2 times before and has a small organisation, I dont know but I heard that political intrest and lobbying as well as a power structure organisation is a sign of a cult, I seriously hope I'm just overthinking.
I'm really struggling to find daming evidence on him being a con man so, please advice me on this",True,False,False,cults,t5_2qzdi,60218,public,self,Think my mother is getting indoctrinated into a cult,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/im65jl/think_my_mother_is_getting_indoctrinated_into_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However from only two days of looking into this, I can't seem to find out the bottom line.Each door that I open just leads to two more,and honestly I don't think I am capable to do this on my own.Let me start by saying this is the first time I have ever posted to reddit. or for that matter been on here longer than a couple of minutes. Anyways, two days ago I came to this website to look for...You guessed it CULTS. And so far within a matter of moments a came across a post saying"" **Cult running distance learning platform** "" and that instantly peaked my interest. And just like that all it took was one search to see the news about the program as a whole. (I'll try to add pics if i can figure out how and add the links)

When you check the news tab you will be greeted by a number of news outlets talking about this program.Looking into them you will find that the education department in Hawaii is going to stop using this program. Why???? Well it's due to the fact that some of the material is a little ""sketchy"".If you look it up there are some questions that are really odd(all also try to add these).Most of these questions can be found still and shy away from the real facts at hand.

DISCLAIMER:YES THEY ARE STILL WRONG BUT ARE MAKING IT HARDER TO PIN THESE PEOPLE FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS.

Now past that I found something very interesting on their facebook page. It's a post with 5 ""sketchy"" things that they were gonna get rid of so that the program could be more PC. Now within in those 5 things is one that opened up and lead me to find some of the weirdest things that just have no context.

DISCLAIMER 2: THIS IS NOT AN ARG THIS IS REAL AND CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE.PLEASE DO NOT START TO THINK OF IT AS A GAME, I FEAR THAT IF WE LOOK AT IT THAT WAY IT WILL BE TAKE AWAY FROM THE OVER ALL REALNESS OF THIS.

So when looking at the 4th problem with the site they mention "" 4. Tagged as unprofessional: A ""screen test"" video of Dr. Pajet Monet was pulled from the Acellus Courseware Development system and published on social media as a bad example of Acellus lessons.  The video was never published, never intended to be part of a lesson, not filmed in the Acellus studio, and was never vetted by the Acellus Review Board. This video could not be deleted from a course because it never was part of any course, and never was shown to any student. "". This grabbed my attention so fast because of just the oddness of """"Screen Test"""" and when trying to look up any information....I came up with zero. Except the name Dr.Pajet Monet. So of course I had to find out who this person is.(you could honestly make a whole other post just about her, But i'll try to give as much info as I have available). with a simple search of the name you will find three very distinct paths to follow: 1.""[https://www.pajet.com/](https://www.pajet.com/) which takes you to her own website where you are able to see who she is and one message she puts out about her self, And her great achievements like ""running her own IT site"" ( ComTech Networking ) and the fact that she got her phd from "" International Academy of Science "" which I will come back to at a later down the post. So besides that there is a video that you have to see to believe,but does help connect some dots later on. Ill try to explain a little about the video but I do strongly suggest watching it yourself. The video is of kids and one adult besides pajet looking extremely sad. Pajet then goes own to talk about how we all feel the ""dark""/""back shadow"" of guilt and other dark words(this I will also come back to) then says that in our soul we have these feelings. She then opens her hands releasing three ""ORBS"" that fly around her almost like they are alive. Pure white orbs fly around to all the children making them happy :) . Now I kid you not this is just some wild stuff.

Now lets move on to ""[http://pajetmonet.blogspot.com/](http://pajetmonet.blogspot.com/)  Which is her own personal blog that dates back until 2012(the dates are VERY important as it helps paint how all this came to be.)Now nothing was that odd about it at first except the gap from 2012-2015 as of 2012 she went to a lot of baseball games and actually got some fame due to the amount of games that the royals in Kansas city won. But only when she was at the games. The last post gives me some incite due to the fact that she is standing with the founder of ""ACELLUS"" Roger Billings who we will also come back to at a later point(also to note he is not mentioned at all in that post which is weird because of how ""famous"" he is . Now after that post there is a whole one year gap. Following is no more posts about base ball but instead ""ACELLUS"".  which in 2018 she got her own personal class known as ""ESP""(no you don't get to talk to ghosts that be way cooler than what the class really is .) ESP or emotional, social &amp; physical ed.

One of the big parts of ""ACELLUS"" is Billings """"TED TALKS"""" called ""talk science"" where he is joined mostly by his co-host Pajet. Where most of  the talks are about science, some seem to push for this idea of love/unity. Which is a good message... but not to large groups of mainly impressionable kids.

Taking a break from the talks I want to talk about the"" third lovely door of pajet"". ""[https://www.fireangel.com/](https://www.fireangel.com/) "" which is where the fun truly begins. With out even scrolling down you can literally read how this is a cult. Where she says how grateful she is that students have said they like the course and that they should ""Reach out"" to other kids and teach them the ways of the ""FireAngel"" Now that is only the tip of the iceberg with Fireangel. Where she says that anyone can be a fireangel. And in fact shes right.

Hey, spread this around the IORG members. It's a warning.

My grandma was OES. My grandpa was a Mason. Every male in the family was in Demolay and became Masons. My aunt was the first one to be in Rainbow in the 70's, and she took her sister (my mother) in the group with her. They loved the group, got scholarships, and had an overall positive experience with it, and both joined OES when they took their majority in Rainbow. They both had no hesitation about having my cousin and I join as pledges and then full members when we got old enough. 

I'm now 21 and this group had given me nothing but trauma and clinically diagnosed PTSD. I was promised a family, I was told I would be a leader and I would honor God, and I would leave this group with many life long friends and useful skills. Haha, no.

I was bullied throughout my teenage years, age 11 - 15, I was talked about behind my back, picked on in front. of the room, humiliated, and. publicly shamed. My weight, my acne,  the way I dressed, when I dyed my hair, my ""attitude"", and nearly everything that a normal teenager deals with was brought into the lime light. ""Oh, they're just teenage girls, it's normal to be picked on a little,"" you may be thinking, but nope. The adults did this alongside the girls. They encouraged it, even. They wanted their pack to have this mindset that they were better than everyone else. You either became one of them, or you were kicked to the curb. 

The most horrendous thing I remember happening is that of the girls from another assembly revealed to me that she had been sexually assaulted by a Rainbow dad/Mason. It had been years since it happened and he had absolutely no consequences because if she came forward and took this to court, she would not have been allowed to be Grand Worthy Advisor. He even kept his position, and the whole thing was kept a secret, because he was the brother in law of a Supreme Assembly member. This scared me to death. I had been assaulted before in my life and now I was at risk of it happening again in this group. 

When I was ready to graduate high school I realized that this group hadn't helped me at all. I had absolutely no idea what I should do with my life except become ""Grand Worthy Advisor"" and ""make God and my family proud."" My one friend I had outside of this group helped me plan what college to go away to, against my mother advisor's advice. I finally had the courage to leave this group after the adults had turned my few friends against me and I was forced to leave everything behind or face their legal team for slander ( I had made a facebook post talking about what I went through in this group).  

My cousin now has a daughter who is a pledge for this group. I fear for her.

He used to sign his name as “[007](https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/bid/274528/The-first-James-Bond-John-Dee-Was-the-Original-007)” and stands as the conceptual foundation for [Ian Fleming’s James Bond](http://www.woe.edu.pl/content/dr-john-dee-original-007) series, he also acts as a early example of how occult practices can inform intelligence and military excursions.\n\n\nIn the latter half of Dee’s life we see a decline in reputation, wealth and mental and physical health as he begins to peruse a series of conversations with angels using a young man by the name of [Edward Kelley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley) as a [medium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship). \n\nIt’s this juxtaposition of credible claims that make the life of John Dee such a fascinating one. \n\nAs a man that definitely existed, little allegory is necessary to decipher the intentions of Mr Dee. \n\nHe spent the first half of his life directing the [British Empire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/waleshistory/2010/12/john_dee_magician_astronomer_astrologer.html) and then left this cause to dive head first into the world of the infallible, the ludicrous and the unknown. \n\nThrough a modern lens this decision might signify a fall from grace and many of Dee’s peers took this stance. \n\nAfter Dee’s public reputation had been tarnished due to  his spiritual exercises reaching the public’s consciousness, he fled in disgrace to Eastern Europe and held meetings with several members of the Polish royal family before returning home to find his house ransacked and his persona vilified. \nDespite this soiling of his image Elizabeth still took pity on him and made him the Warden of the Manchester Cathedral, a position he remained in till his death in 1609.\n\nNow to a skeptical eye the tale of John Dee may come across as interesting, sure, but largely significant only for the historical impact his assistance to Queen Elizabeth had on the expansion of the [British Empire](https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/explore/john-dees-imperial-vision) but this author is willing to out on a limb and say it is the occult workings of Mr Dee that have influenced the world we live in today more than any other aspect of his life.\n\n\nConversations with [angels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat He Said\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nA ridiculous concept from the get go.\n\n\n\nAngels aren’t real therefore Mr Dee was simply a sufferer of a mental alignment like [Schizophrenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) right? \n\nAny writings garnered from this phenomenon should be relegated to the category of the ravings of a madman and have no bearing on the rational world of science that we live in today, if that is, we live in the world one thought we lived in that has been built upon scientific thought and rationality?\n\nI wouldn’t be so fast to dismiss the frenzied visions of Mr Kelley or any perpetrated medium offering revelations from the [astral plane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_plane).\n\nBesides, two of the worlds most popular religions have been formed off of this basis.\n\nThe narratives that surround the origins of the [Islamic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_first_revelation) and [Mormon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates) faiths both feature a very similar tale to the one of John Dee.\n\nAll three men spent time [deprived from their senses](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-10-sensory-deprivation-hallucinations-minutes.html), communicating with a perceived otherworldly intelligence and all three [wrote volumes of writings regarding and “from” the perceived entity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing).\nMohammed and Joseph Smith have large followings as of 2020 and Islam and Mormonism are household names so why have the writings of John Dee fly under the radar?\n\nMaybe it had something to do with the content of what John and Edward were being told by these so called [angels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_angels).\nThe initial concept of a channeling, or mediumship or in short speaking with a deity is so knee jerking in itself that 99% of the time the [baby is thrown out with the bath water.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\'t_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater)\n\nBecause the idea itself is so ludicrous we rarely get around to actually reading the information that was channeled and I believe it is here where a large amount of the skepticism developed when discussing channeled works.\n\nTo understand the angels’s dialogues one must me familiar with the biblical character [Enoch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_(ancestor_of_Noah)) and the associated apocrypha that refers to him.\n\n[Apocrypha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha) is simply a religious work that refers to the main doctrine of a regime on but is not considered “[canon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(basic_principle))” by the representing organisation that surrounds a religion.\n\nFrom the Church’s point of view it’s fan fiction but in a case such as the [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls) some of the oldest copies of the legitimate Bible books were found in a cave near the Red Sea alongside comparatively old versions of a smattering of Christian and Jewish Apocrypha, including a certain [Book of Enoch.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch).\n\nIt’s this “coincidence” that allows one to say that maybe the church’s ousting of apocrypha is motivated not but truth but by control. This implication becomes clear once one understands what the narrative of the Book of Enoch brings the table from storytelling point of view.\n\nYou may have heard the name Enoch listed in the descendants of Adam and Eve after they are kicked out of the Garden of Eden. They begat [Cain, Able and Seth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel) and [started a lineage of humans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogies_of_Genesis) that pass down the story of [man in the garden with the serpent. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man) \n\nThis tale takes place in between the expulsion of AandE from Eden but before Noah’s flood and is referred to a the [Antediluvian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvian) period, the time of [The War In Heaven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Heaven) or the [Titanomachy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy). \n\nThese three words correspond to different cultures speaking upon the same period of time. The [Sumerian’s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer), the [Abrahamic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions) Religions and the [Ancient Greeks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion) are the three listed here but every single religion and culture has a word to describe this period of time. \n\nIt’s seems to refer to a period of time where:\n\n1. [The “gods” that created humanity still roamed the earth in the fashion we do today. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis)\n\n2. [Gods interfered with the affairs of man.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/The-Relationship-between-Gods-and-Mortals-in-FKCVYVFZVJ).\n\n3. Man, in lieu of Science and Rationality, was subservient to a force we now refer to as “god, terms to describe this force are in the thousands and contain but are not limited to [El](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)), [Ba’al](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal), [Elohim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim), [The Watchers and their offspring the Nephillim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(angel)), [The Anunnaki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki), [The Titans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans_(mythology)), [The Ennead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennead)... the list goes on.\n\n4. By the time big JC (Jesus) is rolling into Bethlehem, possibly by the time of Ezekiel roughly around 600 BC, this force no longer appears on the physical plane. It only appears to “chosen”  individuals or mediums and a large amount of [ritualistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual) preparation is required to initiate contact. This period of time also marks a sharp rise in [divination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination) techniques such as the [casting of lots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleromancy), [scrying](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying) and [trance states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance) were utilised to communicate with our estranged creator.\n\nThis set up to the story of the Book of Enoch is required so one can understand what the intelligences John Dee was in communication with were trying to say in the context of the cultural period Dee lived in and the perpetrated time period these so called angels were from. \n\nEnoch is a seventh generation descendant of Adam and Eve and great grandfather to [Noah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah). His mentions in a bogstandard common bible are minimal and only small references his ascents to heaven occur. \n\nOne of note would be shortly before Noah’s [flood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth) and is a mere mention in the Genealogy of Adam to Noah. \nIt simply states, like the 6 preceding ancestors on the list, that Enoch was born to Jared and was the father of Methuselah, in the same fashion as preceding entries. Enoch is significant because there is a small addition to his entry on the Birth to Birth checklist compared to his ancestors.\n\n\nEach patriarch’s [age](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_longevity) is listed and in keeping with pre-flood oddities people were seemingly living to, by today’s standards, unprecedented ages. \n\nAdam lived to 930 and his descendants fare similarly but Enoch is only reported as living for a measly 365 years by comparison and does not “die” in the traditional sense but instead is “taken by God” and is always referred to as “[the one who did not see death](https://www.learnreligions.com/enoch-a-man-who-did-not-die-701150)”.\n\nOtherwise in the basic modern version of the Christian Bible this is the full extent of the explanation of Enoch’s life and can be considered a footnote. A cryptic message to be easily brushed past. Which brings us around to the Book of Enoch.\nAntediluvian literature is particularly difficult to come by namely due to the ambiguity of what was actually happening. Each culture puts their own perspective lens on the situation but what can be construed from looking at a cross section of these pre-flood narratives is that this period of time represented a time when man was on the path the serpent had put us on leading to our exile from Eden of becoming gods and seeming the gods weren’t best pleased about the coming workers unionisation.\n\nI’m going to list a few ancient tales that elude to this time period so one can really pain a picture of what the allegory for this narrative is and paint a vibrant image of the period in ones head. \n\n\n- [The Story of Anu, Enki and Enlil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enûma_Eliš) \n\n- [The Titanomachy](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html) \n\n- [The Books of Enoch 1-3](https://archive.org/details/AllTheBooksOfEnochenoch1Enoch2Enoch3) \n\n- [The Book of Giants ](http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/book_of_giants.pdf) \n\n- [Plato’s telling of Solon’s account of Atlantis ](http://atmo.info/AtlantisPlato.pdf) \n\n\n\nIt is the Sumerian tale of [Enki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki) and [Enlil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlil) that provides us with our context for a War occurring within heaven. \n\nAccording to Sumerian tradition humans were created to [carry the workload](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem) of the gods. They were preceded by a race of smaller workers called the [Igigi](https://www.annunaki.org/the-igigi/) who revolted against upper management (their creator, the gods, Anunaki ect) and this was the catalyst for designing Humanity.\n\n[A worker that didn’t revolt.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)) \n\nThis is the precedent for the  points listed earlier. \n“Gods” and man lived together and gods intervened in the affairs of man. \n\nSome clarification surrounding the word “gods” is required here.\n\nTo understand the difference between a “god” with a small g like Zeus or Enki and the overarching architect of the universe (ie God with a big G), one must look to what [Gnostic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) scriptures called “[The Demierge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge)”.\n\nThis concept relates to the supposed God that appeared to have built Adam and Eve and the \nGarden of Eden and suggests that this god was a sort of self-obsessed [egotistical being](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_(Gnosticism)) that did truly believe it was the creator of the universe whilst mearly being a [imposter](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_archons62.htm).  \nChristian imagery has led us into think of “God” as a [bearded man](https://www.quora.com/Do-atheists-only-think-of-God-as-a-big-man-in-the-sky-Why-arent-they-more-creative-and-thoughtful-with-the-concept/answer/Daniel-Metivier?ch=10&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;share=5f616904&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;srid=CPfIE) in the sky that namely has our best intentions at heart but when one consults the scripture this simply doesn’t seem to be the case. \nIn fact, our father who art in heaven actually seems quite temperamental if the Torah is anything to go by.\n\n\n[Man’s relationship with God in the Torah is akin to one of parent and small child. ](https://www.quora.com/If-Yahweh-is-God-then-why-is-he-always-angry-Isnt-God-supposed-to-be-loving-and-forgiving/answer/John-Wesley-52?ch=10&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;share=266200f6&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;srid=CPfIE) \n\nParent lays down law and leaves to go about errands.\nChild disobeys ruling.\nParent “comes down” and disciplines whilst citing jealousy as the motivation for his anger.\n\nThis occurs numerous times from the [Garden of Eden](https://www.rzim.org/read/a-slice-of-infinity/god-as-gardener) to [Mt Sinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_calf#Biblical_narrative) and loops back round to the story of [Enki and Enlil](https://www.afrikaiswoke.com/2018/04/21/the-sumerian-anunnaki-gods-the-great-deluge-noahs-flood/). \n\nSee in the Sumerian tale Enlil and Enki have equal parts in creating humanity and each have opposing views of [their creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein%27s_monster).\n\nEnlil sees man as subservient to Gods and has little empathy for his creation whilst [Enki may be seen as the fun uncle of humanity, passing in knowledge when possible and even alerting the Sumerian Noah to upcoming flood.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus)\nSo we can see that the Catholic narrative seemingly is a simplification off the original Sumerian and by [amalgamating all this confusing Enki/Enlil business into one simple “God” figure removes the ability for one to discern the personality and aspirations of a deity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system)\n\nQuite a convenient standpoint for a religion that has used its doctrine for the mass control of the entire population to have isn’t it?\n\nDon’t confuse yourself with all this different gods and deities business, just think of it as a big bearded man in the [sky that will send you to hell if you don’t obey his rules.](https://www.thetruthaboutthelaw.com/dont-let-unexamined-fear-control-you-think-for-yourself/) \n\nThat seems to be the mantra of the Catholic Church and it is for this reason that scripture like the [Book of Enoch, whilst still being found with some of the oldest copies of the bible humanity has to date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Scrolls_and_fragments), get relegated to the nonsense pile.\n\nSo basically what I’m saying is, is that the Catholic Church, who’s book is m[ostly considered to be nonsense by most of the general public](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/uk-secularism-on-rise-as-more-than-half-say-they-have-no-religion), are aware of a large amount of texts that have been discovered alongside texts they consider to be “sacred” but consider “some” of them to be pseudepigraphal in nature and it is this authors assumption that this has been done to deter the masses from understand the true nature of god.\n\nWith all this in mind we can now talk about Enoch and his role as a [patriarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch). \n\nIn the Book of Enoch, Enoch is known in his native land as a medium of sorts. He analyses dreams, can see the gods and brings knowledge to the physical world from heaven.\nIt states that the things he sees and brings back from heaven will not transpire to his generation but a future generation to come. \nIt also details the tale of [The Watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_\\(angel\\)), angels that have been cast out of Heaven for disobeying god that have reproduced with earthly women to create what is known as the [Nephillim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim), [Anak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anak) or [GriGori](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Grigori) which can be imagined as [Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant) and [Cyclopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopes), [Sasquatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot) or [Yeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti) like creatures or through a modern scientific lens [Dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_humanoid) and [Large Sea Creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology). \n\nBasically [genetic monstrosities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_\\(Bible\\)) that our creator wants destroying.   \n\nThese angels or Watchers are led by [Azazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel) who is represented in the common day bible by a Goat that has had humanity’s sins placed upon it and cast out into the desert. The very origin of the word scapegoat can be found from this tale and the origins of [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) or [Baphomet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet) having a goats head stem from this tale.\n\n[Another example of how the devils of the catholic dogma are simply well designed smear campaigns against elements of the philosophical landscape that the church wanted suppressed due to their revolutionary nature and depiction of the true nature of god.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) \n\nIt is useful to consult the Islamic scripture on this issue as Azazel and Enoch are both very present in the Quran along with this entire War in Heaven narrative.\n\n[In fact in the Muslim version it is God himself that challenges three angel to live as men to and try to not fall to the temptation of sin and that is how we end up with our Nephillim situation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel#In_Islam) \n\nIt also touches on the menial nature of the wants and actions of gods in comparison to the compassionate needs of humanity.\n\nThe Hindus say that what we are currently experiencing is a[ gods dream](http://www.allabouthinduism.info/2013/03/08/vishnu-the-protector/) and Gnostic scriptures talk of a g[od of nothingness and order bringing about chaos and existence simply out of boredom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_\\(Gnosticism\\)) so for Azazel being known as the scapegoat in allegorical Christian scripture begins to start to make more sense. \n\nEnoch is also know in Islamic scripture as the angel [Idris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_%28prophet%29#Enoch) and can be affiliated with the Christian [Metatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron). \n\nIt is implied that the angels were [sent down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu) to [teach righteousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapa#as_Uanna/Oannes) but were tempted into sin and because of this we have the Nephillim.\n\nWhilst all sin is said to come from Azazel, the set up for this transpiring was instigated by higher management. \nAzazel is said to have [taught man the skills of metal work, cosmetics and deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_\\(mythology\\)) and this is the crime that gets him banished from heaven in the first place. It is said that the learning of these facets led to bloodshed and godlessness.\n[\nTo be blunt, people were eating and fucking one another with no regard for respect or decency and this isn’t good for the sustainability of humanity and therefore god is angered.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin)\n\n[Hence a flood is coming to cleanse this wrongdoing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture) and the resulting Nephillim or offspring of this a period of godlessness are receiving nightmares regarding the upcoming rapture.\n\nIt is Enoch that is called upon to decipher the dreams and direct the giants through the use of [Hekalot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekhalot_literature) literature.  \n\n[Hekalot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekhalot_literature) and [Merkaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism) mysticism relate to a selection of Jewish texts that have been held close to the orthodoxies chest for centuries.\n[Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah) texts also fall under this bracket and all three can be described as texts that facilitate or inform one on the nature, how to communicate with and how to travel through the realm of God. \n\n- Merkaba refers to texts detailing methods of the accent through the heavens.\n\n- Hekalot refers to texts that enable the apparition of the Divine Council.\n\n- Kabbalah relates to texts that describe how god shows him self in the physical world.\n\n[All three of these categories of scripture have rules surrounding them and prior to the advent of the internet revealing these ancient topics was punishable and only a rabbi could only teach them to the most accomplished student.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism#Prohibition_against_study)\n\nAlthough these are fascinating points of research and well worth spending time upon, right now all you need to know is that these texts collect the information these supposed fallen angels gave to humanity and for that reason are considered highly holy and have been kept secret for centuries only to be studied by the upper echelons of the Jewish and Christian hierarchies.\n\nAs we know the flood does come and wipe clean the abominations that covered the earth leaving only Noah, being the only survivor and witness of the old way, to repopulate the world with a sustainable genealogy. The renegade angels get relegated to the fiery pits of [Sheol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol) and we move towards an era when gods are simply a [word of mouth idea not something one sees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination).\n\n\nIt is only at this point, with this context now in place, that we can return to the life of John Dee for to understand the significance of the mans findings one must be aware of the above narratives.\n\nFor the angels that Edward Kelly and Dee apparently spoke to were the very same angels that led the War in Heaven and their writings provide a continuation of the narrative that begin 1,500 years or more prior.\n\n\n\nEdward Kelly met John Dee at the age of 27, being nearly 30 years younger than Dee at the time of their meeting and was fairly instantly thrown into the world of what is known today as [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian) mysticism. \n\nOne may begin to see why the lengthy setup describing Enoch’s life was now necessary.\n\nSee Dee himself had been attempting to communicate with angels on his own for months via Crystal ball gazing to no avail and was looking for a young susceptible medium to take on the more physically demanding evocations. \n\nIt is at this point in John Dee’s tale that the author became rather perplexed at the reality of what seemed to transpire.\n\nSeemingly Mr Kelly would meet up with Mr Dee at his house in [Mortlake](https://www.barnes-history.org.uk/deehome.html), Kelly would induce a trance state by either gazing into a mirror or crystal ball or by ingesting a[ mysterious red powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen) that has yet to be identified and would begin to talk to the angels. \nKelly would relay what they said back to Dee and Dee would act as scribe and take down whatever was being said.\n\nNow this could all be written off as schizophrenic ramblings but there are few points of interest that might make even the most skeptical individual raise an eyebrow.\n\n1. This partnership went on for 7 years. Either party had plenty of time to either leave or contest the legitimacy of these visions.\n\n2. Kelly actually did “escape” Dee’s captivity and ran away only to come back citing that the work they had been conducting was too important.\n\n3. Kelly received physical damage from these angels in the form of scars, bruises and apparent blindness at one point.\n\n4. An entire language referred to as Enochian as been derived from Dee and Kelly’s sessions and is still used today in the [Golden Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn) and [Thelemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema) traditions.\n\n5. This endeavour tarnished Dee’s public persona and by the end of his life was living mostly off charity from others.\n\nThese three points raise large scale concern regarding the perpetrated lunacy of Dee’s occult endeavours and this is without considering what the angels were actually apparently saying.\n\nIf we consider the depictions of the angels from back in Noah’s day they do seem physical in nature and seem to  have long standing effect on the physical world.\nCompare this to the era of Dee and Kelly and they only appear after being summoned and a medium is required to hear their message.\nAlmost like they have been banished or relegated to a space where remote access to this plane is available to them.\n\nFrom Sheol to Earth. \n\nIt seems to imply that in a roundabout sense the apocryphal narrative is correct, these intelligences are no longer physical and can only impact on humanity[ through an avatar so to speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa).\n\nWhich speaks to the idea from the antediluvian story that angels were bound to earth until judgment day in a very literal sense at least in this authors opinion.\nTo elaborate on what I mean one may look into the [nature of the domaine as to where the angels were ""bound"" after the Flood](https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/hell-tartarus-ancient-greek-prison-damned-005527), [the history of the

Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Wave_Systems) \n\nThen you are on the right path to having a chance at understanding what is going on.\n\nFrom their earthbound prison they foretold of a coming apocalypse, in the same vain as was told in the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) and in the revelations of Enoch, although this apocalypse was a coming event not one that was currently transpiring. \nThey spoke with a tone of [contempt for humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt) and preached a message of [detaching from the physical world to dwell in prayer until a time when gods wrath would condemn the malevolent force back to from whence it came.\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation)\n\n\nThe prophecy speaks with an abundance of familiar biblical terms like [Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon), [The Bottomless Pit](https://www.gotquestions.org/bottomless-pit.html) and [The Rising Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_12) which all sound very dated and hard to picture but seen through the correct lens they speak upon the world we live in today. \nObserving the synergy between the systems of Dee and Kelly with the work of the [Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn](http://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Occult_Library/Misc/Occult/Enochian%20Magick%20Volume%201/Zalewski%2C%20Pat%20-%20Golden%20Dawn%20Enochian%20Magic.pdf) and subsequently the works of [Aleister Crowley](https://archive.org/details/LonMiloDuquette-EnochianWorldOfAleisterCrowleyEnochianSexMagick-) and [Jack Parsons](https://sacred-texts.com/oto/lib49.htm) one can see how hypothetically there

world, but combine them together and you have a longstanding tradition of humanity communicating with a force of a higher nature. \nThere would be no point in covering the above cases without prior knowledge of Dee’s attempts to commune with this intelligence and this speaks to why Dee has been covered at this juncture in this series. \n\nThe others will follow.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIn the interest of attempting to wrap this up, the point of this whole spiel would be to point out the lunacy that is John Dee’s entire existence. \n\n\nMuch like this series itself, the sum of the total parts of Dee’s existence make him worth talking about.\n\nHis entire ideology should be relegated to the realms of insanity yet his [angel summoning table made entirely of beeswax is on show at the British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1838-1232-90-a) and it’s things like this that leads one to believe that somebody somewhere takes Dee’s Enochian excursions seriously.\n\nIn the public eye his efforts have been recognised by many contemporary figures such as;\n\n- Damon Alburn of Blur and Gorillaz fame, who wrote and directed an entire opera about Mr Dee titled “[Dr Dee: An English Opera” displaying great knowledge of his angelic conversations.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4juXgHIZ6E) \n\n- Ian Fleming, British Spy and Author (also good friend of [Aleister Crowley potentially also a British spy, more to come on this narrative shortly ;\\)](https://rense.com/general82/crowl.htm) ), [wrote an acclaimed series about a British spy who worked alongside the Queen and signed his name 007](https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2015/12/was-john-dees-fascination-with-the-occult-driven-by-espionage/) as Dr Dee did. \n\n- H.P Lovecraft name dropped Dee citing [Dee as the English translator of a lost mystical book titled “Al Azif” which corresponds to the infamous “Necronomicon”](http://www.digital-brilliance.com/kab/essays/GnosticTrail.htm).  An likely allegorical concept describe a compendium of ancient scared texts, not unlike the apocryphal texts we spoke of earlier.\n\n\nIt is a this juncture that we begin to see the reason for entertaining the life of Mr Dee at all.  \n\nAlthough esoteric nature of his life’s work relegates it’s deciphering to a select group of dedicated occultists, Dee is still a household name to many for his position next to Queen Elizabeth and his contributions to the coinage and expansion of the British Empire and whilst this may be the capacity he is now most well known for as the age of information progress and characters like Crowley and Parsons have their well deserved day in the spotlight, it will be an analysis of Dr Dee’s Enochian Adventures that will really offer a fruitful bounty of first hand knowledge from the a higher intelligences itself.\n\n\n\nUntil next time here at [MIPLTD](https://www.mipltd.org/), Ølund wishes you a fruitful day and restful evening 🙌', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAD PEOPLE WITH SOMETHING TO SAY 0.7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An ongoing project consisting of a collection of biographies of people that have been overlooked in the annals of history.

He used to sign his name as “&lt;a href=""https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/bid/274528/The-first-James-Bond-John-Dee-Was-the-Original-007""&gt;007&lt;/a&gt;” and stands as the conceptual foundation for &lt;a href=""http://www.woe.edu.pl/content/dr-john-dee-original-007""&gt;Ian Fleming’s James Bond&lt;/a&gt; series, he also acts as a early example of how occult practices can inform intelligence and military excursions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the latter half of Dee’s life we see a decline in reputation, wealth and mental and physical health as he begins to peruse a series of conversations with angels using a young man by the name of &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley""&gt;Edward Kelley&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship""&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s this juxtaposition of credible claims that make the life of John Dee such a fascinating one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a man that definitely existed, little allegory is necessary to decipher the intentions of Mr Dee. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spent the first half of his life directing the &lt;a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/waleshistory/2010/12/john_dee_magician_astronomer_astrologer.html""&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; and then left this cause to dive head first into the world of the infallible, the ludicrous and the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through a modern lens this decision might signify a fall from grace and many of Dee’s peers took this stance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Dee’s public reputation had been tarnished due to  his spiritual exercises reaching the public’s consciousness, he fled in disgrace to Eastern Europe and held meetings with several members of the Polish royal family before returning home to find his house ransacked and his persona vilified. \nDespite this soiling of his image Elizabeth still took pity on him and made him the Warden of the Manchester Cathedral, a position he remained in till his death in 1609.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to a skeptical eye the tale of John Dee may come across as interesting, sure, but largely significant only for the historical impact his assistance to Queen Elizabeth had on the expansion of the &lt;a href=""https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/explore/john-dees-imperial-vision""&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; but this author is willing to out on a limb and say it is the occult workings of Mr Dee that have influenced the world we live in today more than any other aspect of his life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conversations with &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel""&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What He Said&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A ridiculous concept from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angels aren’t real therefore Mr Dee was simply a sufferer of a mental alignment like &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia""&gt;Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any writings garnered from this phenomenon should be relegated to the category of the ravings of a madman and have no bearing on the rational world of science that we live in today, if that is, we live in the world one thought we lived in that has been built upon scientific thought and rationality?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be so fast to dismiss the frenzied visions of Mr Kelley or any perpetrated medium offering revelations from the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_plane""&gt;astral plane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, two of the worlds most popular religions have been formed off of this basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The narratives that surround the origins of the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_first_revelation""&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates""&gt;Mormon&lt;/a&gt; faiths both feature a very similar tale to the one of John Dee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All three men spent time &lt;a href=""https://medicalxpress.com/news/2009-10-sensory-deprivation-hallucinations-minutes.html""&gt;deprived from their senses&lt;/a&gt;, communicating with a perceived otherworldly intelligence and all three &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_writing""&gt;wrote volumes of writings regarding and “from” the perceived entity&lt;/a&gt;.\nMohammed and Joseph Smith have large followings as of 2020 and Islam and Mormonism are household names so why have the writings of John Dee fly under the radar?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it had something to do with the content of what John and Edward were being told by these so called &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_angels""&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe initial concept of a channeling, or mediumship or in short speaking with a deity is so knee jerking in itself that 99% of the time the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&amp;#x27;t_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater""&gt;baby is thrown out with the bath water.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the idea itself is so ludicrous we rarely get around to actually reading the information that was channeled and I believe it is here where a large amount of the skepticism developed when discussing channeled works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand the angels’s dialogues one must me familiar with the biblical character &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_(ancestor_of_Noah""&gt;Enoch&lt;/a&gt;) and the associated apocrypha that refers to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocrypha""&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; is simply a religious work that refers to the main doctrine of a regime on but is not considered “&lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(basic_principle""&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;)” by the representing organisation that surrounds a religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the Church’s point of view it’s fan fiction but in a case such as the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls""&gt;Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; some of the oldest copies of the legitimate Bible books were found in a cave near the Red Sea alongside comparatively old versions of a smattering of Christian and Jewish Apocrypha, including a certain &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch""&gt;Book of Enoch.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s this “coincidence” that allows one to say that maybe the church’s ousting of apocrypha is motivated not but truth but by control. This implication becomes clear once one understands what the narrative of the Book of Enoch brings the table from storytelling point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may have heard the name Enoch listed in the descendants of Adam and Eve after they are kicked out of the Garden of Eden. They begat &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel""&gt;Cain, Able and Seth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogies_of_Genesis""&gt;started a lineage of humans&lt;/a&gt; that pass down the story of &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man""&gt;man in the garden with the serpent. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This tale takes place in between the expulsion of AandE from Eden but before Noah’s flood and is referred to a the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antediluvian""&gt;Antediluvian&lt;/a&gt; period, the time of &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Heaven""&gt;The War In Heaven&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy""&gt;Titanomachy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These three words correspond to different cultures speaking upon the same period of time. The &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer""&gt;Sumerian’s&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions""&gt;Abrahamic&lt;/a&gt; Religions and the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion""&gt;Ancient Greeks&lt;/a&gt; are the three listed here but every single religion and culture has a word to describe this period of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s seems to refer to a period of time where:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis""&gt;The “gods” that created humanity still roamed the earth in the fashion we do today. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bartleby.com/essay/The-Relationship-between-Gods-and-Mortals-in-FKCVYVFZVJ""&gt;Gods interfered with the affairs of man.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man, in lieu of Science and Rationality, was subservient to a force we now refer to as “god, terms to describe this force are in the thousands and contain but are not limited to &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity""&gt;El&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal""&gt;Ba’al&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim""&gt;Elohim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(angel""&gt;The Watchers and their offspring the Nephillim&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki""&gt;The Anunnaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titans_(mythology""&gt;The Titans&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennead""&gt;The Ennead&lt;/a&gt;... the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time big JC (Jesus) is rolling into Bethlehem, possibly by the time of Ezekiel roughly around 600 BC, this force no longer appears on the physical plane. It only appears to “chosen”  individuals or mediums and a large amount of &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual""&gt;ritualistic&lt;/a&gt; preparation is required to initiate contact. This period of time also marks a sharp rise in &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination""&gt;divination&lt;/a&gt; techniques such as the &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleromancy""&gt;casting of lots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying""&gt;scrying&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance""&gt;trance states&lt;/a&gt; were utilised to communicate with our estranged creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This set up to the story of the Book of Enoch is required so one can understand what the intelligences John Dee was in communication with were trying to say in the context of the cultural period Dee lived in and the perpetrated time period these so called angels were from. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enoch is a seventh generation descendant of Adam and Eve and great grandfather to &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah""&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt;. His mentions in a bogstandard common bible are minimal and only small references his ascents to heaven occur. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of note would be shortly before Noah’s &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth""&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt; and is a mere mention in the Genealogy of Adam to Noah. \nIt simply states, like the 6 preceding ancestors on the list, that Enoch was born to Jared and was the father of Methuselah, in the same fashion as preceding entries. Enoch is significant because there is a small addition to his entry on the Birth to Birth checklist compared to his ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each patriarch’s &lt;a href=""https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Biblical_longevity""&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; is listed and in keeping with pre-flood oddities people were seemingly living to, by today’s standards, unprecedented ages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam lived to 930 and his descendants fare similarly but Enoch is only reported as living for a measly 365 years by comparison and does not “die” in the traditional sense but instead is “taken by God” and is always referred to as “&lt;a href=""https://www.learnreligions.com/enoch-a-man-who-did-not-die-701150""&gt;the one who did not see death&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise in the basic modern version of the Christian Bible this is the full extent of the explanation of Enoch’s life and can be considered a footnote. A cryptic message to be easily brushed past. Which brings us around to the Book of Enoch.\nAntediluvian literature is particularly difficult to come by namely due to the ambiguity of what was actually happening. Each culture puts their own perspective lens on the situation but what can be construed from looking at a cross section of these pre-flood narratives is that this period of time represented a time when man was on the path the serpent had put us on leading to our exile from Eden of becoming gods and seeming the gods weren’t best pleased about the coming workers unionisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m going to list a few ancient tales that elude to this time period so one can really pain a picture of what the allegory for this narrative is and paint a vibrant image of the period in ones head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/En%C3%BBma_Eli%C5%A1""&gt;The Story of Anu, Enki and Enlil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Titanomachy/titanomachy.html""&gt;The Titanomachy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://archive.org/details/AllTheBooksOfEnochenoch1Enoch2Enoch3""&gt;The Books of Enoch 1-3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/book_of_giants.pdf""&gt;The Book of Giants &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://atmo.info/AtlantisPlato.pdf""&gt;Plato’s telling of Solon’s account of Atlantis &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is the Sumerian tale of &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki""&gt;Enki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlil""&gt;Enlil&lt;/a&gt; that provides us with our context for a War occurring within heaven. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Sumerian tradition humans were created to &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem""&gt;carry the workload&lt;/a&gt; of the gods. They were preceded by a race of smaller workers called the &lt;a href=""https://www.annunaki.org/the-igigi/""&gt;Igigi&lt;/a&gt; who revolted against upper management (their creator, the gods, Anunaki ect) and this was the catalyst for designing Humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot""&gt;A worker that didn’t revolt.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the precedent for the  points listed earlier. \n“Gods” and man lived together and gods intervened in the affairs of man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some clarification surrounding the word “gods” is required here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand the difference between a “god” with a small g like Zeus or Enki and the overarching architect of the universe (ie God with a big G), one must look to what &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism""&gt;Gnostic&lt;/a&gt; scriptures called “&lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge""&gt;The Demierge&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concept relates to the supposed God that appeared to have built Adam and Eve and the \nGarden of Eden and suggests that this god was a sort of self-obsessed &lt;a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon_(Gnosticism""&gt;egotistical being&lt;/a&gt;) that did truly believe it was the creator of the universe whilst mearly being a &lt;a href=""https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_archons62.htm""&gt;imposter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\nChristian imagery has led us into think of “God” as a &lt;a href=""https://www.quora.com/Do-atheists-only-think-of-God-as-a-big-man-in-the-sky-Why-arent-they-more-creative-and-thoughtful-with-the-concept/answer/Daniel-Metivier?ch=10&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;share=5f616904&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;srid=CPfIE""&gt;bearded man&lt;/a&gt; in the sky that namely has our best intentions at heart but when one consults the scripture this simply doesn’t seem to be the case. \nIn fact, our father who art in heaven actually seems quite temperamental if the Torah is anything to go by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.quora.com/If-Yahweh-is-God-then-why-is-he-always-angry-Isnt-God-supposed-to-be-loving-and-forgiving/answer/John-Wesley-52?ch=10&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;share=266200f6&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;srid=CPfIE""&gt;Man’s relationship with God in the Torah is akin to one of parent and small child. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parent lays down law and leaves to go about errands.\nChild disobeys ruling.\nParent “comes down” and disciplines whilst citing jealousy as the motivation for his anger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This occurs numerous times from the &lt;a href=""https://www.rzim.org/read/a-slice-of-infinity/god-as-gardener""&gt;Garden of Eden&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_calf#Biblical_narrative""&gt;Mt Sinai&lt;/a&gt; and loops back round to the story of &lt;a href=""https://www.afrikaiswoke.com/2018/04/21/the-sumerian-anunnaki-gods-the-great-deluge-noahs-flood/""&gt;Enki and Enlil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See in the Sumerian tale Enlil and Enki have equal parts in creating humanity and each have opposing views of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein%27s_monster""&gt;their creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enlil sees man as subservient to Gods and has little empathy for his creation whilst &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus""&gt;Enki may be seen as the fun uncle of humanity, passing in knowledge when possible and even alerting the Sumerian Noah to upcoming flood.&lt;/a&gt;\nSo we can see that the Catholic narrative seemingly is a simplification off the original Sumerian and by &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system""&gt;amalgamating all this confusing Enki/Enlil business into one simple “God” figure removes the ability for one to discern the personality and aspirations of a deity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quite a convenient standpoint for a religion that has used its doctrine for the mass control of the entire population to have isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse yourself with all this different gods and deities business, just think of it as a big bearded man in the &lt;a href=""https://www.thetruthaboutthelaw.com/dont-let-unexamined-fear-control-you-think-for-yourself/""&gt;sky that will send you to hell if you don’t obey his rules.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That seems to be the mantra of the Catholic Church and it is for this reason that scripture like the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Scrolls_and_fragments""&gt;Book of Enoch, whilst still being found with some of the oldest copies of the bible humanity has to date&lt;/a&gt;, get relegated to the nonsense pile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically what I’m saying is, is that the Catholic Church, who’s book is m&lt;a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/uk-secularism-on-rise-as-more-than-half-say-they-have-no-religion""&gt;ostly considered to be nonsense by most of the general public&lt;/a&gt;, are aware of a large amount of texts that have been discovered alongside texts they consider to be “sacred” but consider “some” of them to be pseudepigraphal in nature and it is this authors assumption that this has been done to deter the masses from understand the true nature of god.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind we can now talk about Enoch and his role as a &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch""&gt;patriarch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Book of Enoch, Enoch is known in his native land as a medium of sorts. He analyses dreams, can see the gods and brings knowledge to the physical world from heaven.\nIt states that the things he sees and brings back from heaven will not transpire to his generation but a future generation to come. \nIt also details the tale of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(angel)""&gt;The Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, angels that have been cast out of Heaven for disobeying god that have reproduced with earthly women to create what is known as the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephilim""&gt;Nephillim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anak""&gt;Anak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Grigori""&gt;GriGori&lt;/a&gt; which can be imagined as &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant""&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopes""&gt;Cyclopes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot""&gt;Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti""&gt;Yeti&lt;/a&gt; like creatures or through a modern scientific lens &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_humanoid""&gt;Dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology""&gt;Large Sea Creatures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_(Bible)""&gt;genetic monstrosities&lt;/a&gt; that our creator wants destroying.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These angels or Watchers are led by &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel""&gt;Azazel&lt;/a&gt; who is represented in the common day bible by a Goat that has had humanity’s sins placed upon it and cast out into the desert. The very origin of the word scapegoat can be found from this tale and the origins of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan""&gt;Satan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet""&gt;Baphomet&lt;/a&gt; having a goats head stem from this tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda""&gt;Another example of how the devils of the catholic dogma are simply well designed smear campaigns against elements of the philosophical landscape that the church wanted suppressed due to their revolutionary nature and depiction of the true nature of god.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is useful to consult the Islamic scripture on this issue as Azazel and Enoch are both very present in the Quran along with this entire War in Heaven narrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel#In_Islam""&gt;In fact in the Muslim version it is God himself that challenges three angel to live as men to and try to not fall to the temptation of sin and that is how we end up with our Nephillim situation.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also touches on the menial nature of the wants and actions of gods in comparison to the compassionate needs of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hindus say that what we are currently experiencing is a&lt;a href=""http://www.allabouthinduism.info/2013/03/08/vishnu-the-protector/""&gt; gods dream&lt;/a&gt; and Gnostic scriptures talk of a g&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)""&gt;od of nothingness and order bringing about chaos and existence simply out of boredom&lt;/a&gt; so for Azazel being known as the scapegoat in allegorical Christian scripture begins to start to make more sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enoch is also know in Islamic scripture as the angel &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_%28prophet%29#Enoch""&gt;Idris&lt;/a&gt; and can be affiliated with the Christian &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron""&gt;Metatron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is implied that the angels were &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apkallu""&gt;sent down&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapa#as_Uanna/Oannes""&gt;teach righteousness&lt;/a&gt; but were tempted into sin and because of this we have the Nephillim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst all sin is said to come from Azazel, the set up for this transpiring was instigated by higher management. \nAzazel is said to have &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_(mythology)""&gt;taught man the skills of metal work, cosmetics and deception&lt;/a&gt; and this is the crime that gets him banished from heaven in the first place. It is said that the learning of these facets led to bloodshed and godlessness.\n&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin""&gt;\nTo be blunt, people were eating and fucking one another with no regard for respect or decency and this isn’t good for the sustainability of humanity and therefore god is angered.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture""&gt;Hence a flood is coming to cleanse this wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting Nephillim or offspring of this a period of godlessness are receiving nightmares regarding the upcoming rapture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is Enoch that is called upon to decipher the dreams and direct the giants through the use of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekhalot_literature""&gt;Hekalot&lt;/a&gt; literature.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekhalot_literature""&gt;Hekalot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism""&gt;Merkaba&lt;/a&gt; mysticism relate to a selection of Jewish texts that have been held close to the orthodoxies chest for centuries.\n&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah""&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/a&gt; texts also fall under this bracket and all three can be described as texts that facilitate or inform one on the nature, how to communicate with and how to travel through the realm of God. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merkaba refers to texts detailing methods of the accent through the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hekalot refers to texts that enable the apparition of the Divine Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kabbalah relates to texts that describe how god shows him self in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism#Prohibition_against_study""&gt;All three of these categories of scripture have rules surrounding them and prior to the advent of the internet revealing these ancient topics was punishable and only a rabbi could only teach them to the most accomplished student.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although these are fascinating points of research and well worth spending time upon, right now all you need to know is that these texts collect the information these supposed fallen angels gave to humanity and for that reason are considered highly holy and have been kept secret for centuries only to be studied by the upper echelons of the Jewish and Christian hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we know the flood does come and wipe clean the abominations that covered the earth leaving only Noah, being the only survivor and witness of the old way, to repopulate the world with a sustainable genealogy. The renegade angels get relegated to the fiery pits of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol""&gt;Sheol&lt;/a&gt; and we move towards an era when gods are simply a &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination""&gt;word of mouth idea not something one sees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is only at this point, with this context now in place, that we can return to the life of John Dee for to understand the significance of the mans findings one must be aware of the above narratives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the angels that Edward Kelly and Dee apparently spoke to were the very same angels that led the War in Heaven and their writings provide a continuation of the narrative that begin 1,500 years or more prior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edward Kelly met John Dee at the age of 27, being nearly 30 years younger than Dee at the time of their meeting and was fairly instantly thrown into the world of what is known today as &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian""&gt;Enochian&lt;/a&gt; mysticism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One may begin to see why the lengthy setup describing Enoch’s life was now necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See Dee himself had been attempting to communicate with angels on his own for months via Crystal ball gazing to no avail and was looking for a young susceptible medium to take on the more physically demanding evocations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is at this point in John Dee’s tale that the author became rather perplexed at the reality of what seemed to transpire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seemingly Mr Kelly would meet up with Mr Dee at his house in &lt;a href=""https://www.barnes-history.org.uk/deehome.html""&gt;Mortlake&lt;/a&gt;, Kelly would induce a trance state by either gazing into a mirror or crystal ball or by ingesting a&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen""&gt; mysterious red powder&lt;/a&gt; that has yet to be identified and would begin to talk to the angels. \nKelly would relay what they said back to Dee and Dee would act as scribe and take down whatever was being said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this could all be written off as schizophrenic ramblings but there are few points of interest that might make even the most skeptical individual raise an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This partnership went on for 7 years. Either party had plenty of time to either leave or contest the legitimacy of these visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly actually did “escape” Dee’s captivity and ran away only to come back citing that the work they had been conducting was too important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly received physical damage from these angels in the form of scars, bruises and apparent blindness at one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An entire language referred to as Enochian as been derived from Dee and Kelly’s sessions and is still used today in the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn""&gt;Golden Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema""&gt;Thelemic&lt;/a&gt; traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This endeavour tarnished Dee’s public persona and by the end of his life was living mostly off charity from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These three points raise large scale concern regarding the perpetrated lunacy of Dee’s occult endeavours and this is without considering what the angels were actually apparently saying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we consider the depictions of the angels from back in Noah’s day they do seem physical in nature and seem to  have long standing effect on the physical world.\nCompare this to the era of Dee and Kelly and they only appear after being summoned and a medium is required to hear their message.\nAlmost like they have been banished or relegated to a space where remote access to this plane is available to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Sheol to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to imply that in a roundabout sense the apocryphal narrative is correct, these intelligences are no longer physical and can only impact on humanity&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa""&gt;

), &lt;a href=""https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2015/12/was-john-dees-fascination-with-the-occult-driven-by-espionage/""&gt;wrote an acclaimed series about a British spy who worked alongside the Queen and signed his name 007&lt;/a&gt;

Hey. What do Hot Fuzz, Resident Evil, Evil Dead, die-hard Trump fans, Nazis, Scientologists, abusive cops, and some workers in nightmarish black market scenes from Max Payne have in common?

I occasionally run from cultists who are basically a combination of them in my dreams. It all starts with people who appear to be totally normal on the surface. Like pleasant-looking old librarians. Until they start saying weird things.

Thinking they can be talked out of their toxic beliefs, I give their level of ignorance the benefit of doubt, and try to subtly slip in a word of reality. They give a “Karen glare.” I look around and realize they’re all over the place. A single one goes on a power trip trying to taunt me while wearing a big smile, and then attacks me. Much like a violent bully. I’m forced into cutting a bitch back when they get too physically dangerous.

Following me defending myself, I end up running from an increasingly coalescing angered swarm of their cultist peers. Out for my blood.
