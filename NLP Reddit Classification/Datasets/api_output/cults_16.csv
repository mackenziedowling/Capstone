We bonded a lot, he was super chill and funny, and we liked the same video games and would go see movies together a lot.  I found out at our second group meetup that he used to be a member of Spirit Science like me.  We started talking about our experiences and realized that we were both did extremely dangerous things via instruction from Jordan, the leader.  I never thought what happened to me was that bad, but he sort of opened my eyes.

I had joined and was a devout follower.  I started holding racist views that I didn't realize were racist, like infantilizing Jewish people and fetishising cultures and practices from across Asia.  I started spending my money on bogus treatments for physical and spiritual health.  I stopped taking my medications that I needed for my chronic illness and depression.  I had a organic raw vegan diet.  I began fasting.  Eventually it spiraled into an eating disorder.  I started hallucinating, experiencing paranoia, was extremely fatigued and always in pain due to my chronic illnesses, and had very little money because I was spending it all on bogus treatments and organic fruits and vegetables, and then I felt like I was expected to make more money to buy psychedelics and go on trips to the Carribean with Jordan on a trip he was sponsored by to basically trip for five days.  I felt like a failure.  I was told that if I was still physically or mentally ill even after eating organic and raw vegan and abstaining big pharma, that it was still my fault and that I had spiritual blockage.  It wasn't until I heard him talk about Teal Swan and looked into her that I left.  When I saw that she was advocating for suicide normalization and saying that it was completely okay, that was my wakeup call.

Max, on the other hand, still considered himself a member.  He still followed a lot of their beliefs but seemed to be better off.  It wasn't until I found out he had been drinking crystal water at their request that I was concerned, because he was regularly drinking water that had crystals soaked in them.  Now some argue that this is okay with certain crystals like quartzes (amethyst, jasper, citrine, etc), but he was drinking malachite crystal water, which has copper in it.  He wasn't told how to go about making safe crystal water, just to have a crystal sit in a water bottle and then drink it.  Max didn't realize that if he didn't stop he would end up getting severe copper poisoning.  Thankfully, he didn't somehow.  But after that incident he left.

Now I don't think Spirit Science is as bad as other cults like Scientology or Quiverfull.  They don't practice excommunication, they have (bullshit) disclaimers saying ""listen to your body"" and that they're not claiming anything works for legal purposes.  They still pass the BITE model, however.

Behavior - they tell people how to live their lives in multiple ways, from telling you how to eat, what drugs to take, and even what color to paint your bedroom walls to clear your chakras.  I was told to not give money to homeless people and to give them crystals instead because it would benefit them more.

Information - They use bogus scientific articles to support their claims for spirituality.  They'll misquote articles or use debunked sources to support claims like saying the moon is hollow or that Hebrews are descended from aliens.

Thought - They push the belief that your health issues are a result of your negative thoughts.  That's about the extent of it, but that shit hurt.

Emotion - They're really big on love bombing and subtle guilt tripping.  I remember in a video where they were talking about eating raw and organic where someone mentioned living in an area where organic raw vegan food is not readily available.  He started to guilt trip her into thinking she wasn't doing enough by saying that she should be growing her own food if she can't buy it, and I don't think this guy knows how much food you have to grow to feed yourself alone.

I know I don't have nearly as bad of an experience as others, but I think that the presence of internet cults needs to be examined.  Especially now when we're in such a time of uncertainty and so many young people are feeling a sense of hopelessness and loss while simultaneously showing interest in spirituality, we all need to make sure that new age stuff we see online isn't anything more nefarious.",True,False,False,cults,t5_2qzdi,60080,public,self,Spirit Science,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/ikpz76/spirit_science/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'll start by saying that last year, I started noticing this strange behavior in my mom, and the incredibly strange things she would say to me.

For background, my mom is 48 years old and recently divorced. Back when we were still living as a family together with my dad and younger brother prior to the divorce, our living environment was always chaotic because of my brother's drug addiction. On top of that, she was unemployed and stuck in a bad marriage. Had maybe one friend, who she was not even that close to. So kind of an easy target as far as cults go. Somebody living a stressful, unstable, unsatisfying life with few connections to the outside world. She had always had Christian evangelical leanings, so unfortunately I didn't catch on right away that some of the beliefs she was espousing were anything out of the ordinary.

She learned about B.D. Hyman's ministry thanks to an article online about a book B.D. wrote about her mother, Bette Davis, where she claimed Bette Davis practiced witchcraft and abused her and was an all-around terrible woman. (Whether or not you believe these allegations are true isn't relevant here, I'm not going to address them.) My mom started watching her ministry youtube videos, of which there are tons of, each hours long. She also revealed to me she would occasionally talk to this woman over the phone and would ask her things like which media was okay to consume.

Eventually this lead to a whole slew of weird behavior and a total shift in beliefs and temperament. She started to believe she could heal things or make things happen just using her mind, because apparently B.D. told her that she was able to redirect a tornado once using her strong belief in god. She suddenly frowned upon going to doctors, which she did not used to do. She started to swear off all media, claiming it was satanic and meant to lead people astray from god. She talked down on other Christians constantly, saying they didn't know The Truth like she did. Her beliefs suddenly became incredibly black and white, and almost every conversation we had would inevitably turn into an argument because I fundamentally disagree with everything this cult stands for, and disagreeing is not allowed. She started to idolize the idea of financial wealth and excess in a way she didn't used to. She would constantly threaten to kick me out even though I'm disabled and rely on her for financial support and have virtually nowhere else to go. She would also claim I could just ""cure"" my incurable chronic illness at will if I would just change my belief set to hers and pray to god all the time and that the fact that I wasn't doing that meant that I ""loved being miserable."" Her empathy towards me and other people was completely squandered.

And then the distancing from family and friends started. One day she said to me, ""God told me he would financially bless me, but he said I have to move away from you first."" (I was very concerned about this before I knew just what in the fuck was actually going with her. At first I thought she was suffering from schizophrenia, because normal people do not just claim they get messages like this from god.) Eventually she stopped talking to her mom, the only person other than me who she talked to with any regularity. She stopped responding to texts from my brother, and wouldn't even let him visit the apartment like he used to from time to time, claiming she didn't want him to ""curse her household"" or ""block her from spiritual blessings."" Eventually that rule was extended to my friends, too.

She would shut herself up in her room suddenly for days at a time, and when questioned about anything she would get defensive and respond with hostility. She would use the word ""blessed"" to describe her living situation regularly even though she was clearly not happy and running out of divorce money to support herself. She would use other strange phrases and terminology, like ""yoked to unbelievers"" and ""the church is not the bride"" which she would repeat when given the opportunity.

When we would get into arguments she'd become incredibly mean and nasty and call me shit like ""the antichrist"" and tell me I was satanic etc etc etc. Even when I was going out of my way to be nice to her and follow her rules she still acted like I was possessed and deserving of abuse. Nothing nice I did or said to her made any dent in her screwed up ideology and views of the outside world. It was entirely pointless to talk to her about anything other than the weather or maybe food, because anything else turned into an argument. Eventually I got tired of the abuse and just stopped talking to her completely, for my own mental well-being.

Last December I finally put the pieces together and figured out she was showing signs of brainwashing and realized [B.D. Hyman's ministry is a cult](http://bdhyman.com/finding-a-church/). Among her [ministry's tenets](http://bdhyman.com/tenets/) are tithing, and apparently 10% of any new income you receive is the minimum. It is not optional. She has hours and hours of free audio lectures on dropbox as advertised on her ministry's website and I listened to the one about finances (*Our Financial Covenant*) wherein she explicitly says she doesn't care if you're struggling financially, you need to tithe 10% of anything you earn or receive, even as a gift, or you won't receive blessings. She basically runs this evangelical prosperity gospel type cult, where she says Christian followers are not meant to suffer, but be blessed and ""live like kings"" on earth. Her big claim is that anything that you tithe to her church, you will receive back 100 fold from god as a reward. She uses this phrase, ""rebuke the devourer"" which is just code for telling people to not pay their bills or insurance, because it should be spent on her church and your belief in god means you don't need insurance. Y i k e s.

The whole thing is incredibly financially predatory. And I've already seen a letter on my mom's desk from the car insurance company saying she didn't make the last payment. I'm seriously worried we're going to end up with utilities shut off at some point and evicted because I don't know how much money she's handing this woman.

So far I haven't seen anybody talk about this ministry being a cult, and I have a feeling it's a fairly small cult from the sound of things. I found a [page of reviews for her actual physical ministry](http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3723058357/kings-corner-fellowship-charlottesville), and it sounds like she wasn't super successful at wrangling up followers that way. Unsurprisingly, most of the reviews are negative. So she seems to have shifted most of her focus online.

I have C.P..T.S.D,  I was illegaly imprisoned tortured and raped for 6.5 years as a child on the island of Jersey in the English channel. For 65 years this island thats not that far off the coast of France is privatly owned by the Queen of England.These Islands chief of which and largest is Jersey.

&amp;#x200B;

This Island /s are immune from E.U human rights laws and English law.

This is the holiday destination of Jimmy Savile child rapist murdera and canibal and necrophile.

The ""Staff"" at the instituation I was in all come from majore ciies through out the England 1 from Manchester 1 from Scotland 1 from Wales 1 from Newcastle...as you can see they came a fair distance to be in this pacific place.

Jersey since 1944-45, by its own admition. has been unable to stop more than 4 illegal child prisons and 10's of child abuse institutions from hospital wings in the one and only hospital on the island ion that entire time to such things as ""cottage"" homes , this where a man and a women like a surgate parents look after no more than 4 children. [https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2015/07/31/im-sorry-for-regime-of-abuse-by-maguires/](https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2015/07/31/im-sorry-for-regime-of-abuse-by-maguires/) this one of the homes I used to go to in the summer holidays.

The island was and probably still is scattered with these types of abuse homes.

[https://youtu.be/gQB7XJ7OhaE](https://youtu.be/gQB7XJ7OhaE) , or you may remember this [https://youtu.be/lq6lJsBz9UY](https://youtu.be/lq6lJsBz9UY) were we were hung up and had copper wire tied and wrapped around our legs and other bits then elctricuted.

&amp;#x200B;

The point I am getting at is if you follow all the so called ""staff"" and check were they are from...they are all in or related to entire familes in the Freemasons. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry). They claim to be abrotherly faturnaity....but they are not...their members include such as the yorkshire ripper...peter sutcliff [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter\_Sutcliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sutcliffe) , [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-frank-bruno-reveals-1430910](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-frank-bruno-reveals-1430910) here is jimmy savile with peter sutrcliff left performing the freemasons handshake with boxer frank bruno.

They are a cult.....they claim to be a secret organisation...well its not much of a secret.

The former deputy head of my last institute of illegal confinment is now the head of a school for Vulnrable children in Southampton.

I have 3 differant police stations telling me its not a crime for her to work with children including offsted (gouverment watch body for school standerderds) and the local council here she is [https://www.polygon.southampton.sch.uk/welcome-to-our-school/](https://www.polygon.southampton.sch.uk/welcome-to-our-school/).

&amp;#x200B;

I got paid £4000 for reporting my rape as a child and £10,000 for being illegaly imprisoned for 247 days or the like..and that took me 30 years to get!! they claimed you couldnt claim for the hours you were asleep there.She earns more in a year than any of us got for being illegaly imprisoned tortured raped denied health care and denied an education.

So how is it possible for medical records for 30 years of my own life to go missing in the one and only hospital on the island? and then how for 35 years before I was even born was the same thing going on?

Its simple but you wont like it...it what the island is for...it was designed for this.

Out of its 100,000 of inhabitants...not 1 EVER has punched slapped or harmed one of these abusers that still live on the same island thats only 5 miles by 9.

The numbers dont lie...its a controled isle by a cult...the freemasons.",True,False,False,cults,t5_2qzdi,59951,public,self,65 years of the same shit on an island 9 miles by 5,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/ik9mxa/65_years_of_the_same_shit_on_an_island_9_miles_by/,no_ads,0.0,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '8O5-qyCyrdPosoJShIlPp6Emv3fzt1ALdFDgKIZoisk', 'resolutions': [{'height': 72, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=723bd39ec26f2795c1aa19e155d0c3f66c1248bd', 'width': 108}, {'height': 144, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=153c6135614f68ce7244c102bafc181c3475b40d', 'width': 216}, {'height': 213, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89dd726afc9fe1124242c51f7ce0bd03e39942e7', 'width': 320}, {'height': 426, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa30cc2739aaa069e5b7f9b6fb18f50d027090e7', 'width': 640}, {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2873cfdcd5756e53be88f2471e4e6fabff619280', 'width': 960}, {'height': 720, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6823e60533896c85e3c523d68055d9ebd4698c73', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 800, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/iqTF6O3ke-RjFYee7Cg0OFs3J9BoQi1TM0O7ZRYPG-E.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0af408c0dcf17148053bd209c3df64e851d477a4', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My grandma raised me and talked about him constantly. I had kids books about Ramtha, and my grandma has all of JZ's books.

Aside from Ramtha, my grandma was a member of the church of Scientology. She believes all the negative things about Scientology are made up by the government. All negative things about Ramtha are also made up by the government because they know it's the truth. 

I believe that she had ties at one point to Heaven's Gate, but she will not admit to any such thing just like she'll tell you she's never smoked a single marijuana in her life. Mhm.. 

The thing I hate most about Ramtha is the belief that you choose everything in your life. My mom was less than good to me growing up. My grandma (who is super nice, btw) will tell me that I chose my mom for a reason. I told her if I had a choice, I'd be a Koch. If I'm having a bad day, she says that I create my own reality. This applies to bad luck, pain, etc. Things that I literally can't control. You can't get food poisoning if you create the reality that the food won't get you sick.

I'm sure it's meant to be reassuring, but I find it highly dismissive. 

Aside from that, she believe that all diseases are caused by parasites (re: The Cure for All Diseases by  Hulda Regehr Clark), all vaccines are bad and can be detoxed by drink lots of water, you can only drink distilled water, you should never take iron because iron is a metal and not meant to be consumed, all modern medicine is evil.

It seems like they're still active today.

I've seen one or two posts in other places about this video, but nothing that really helped me learn anything about it. Those posts were buried pretty deep.

It was around midnight and I was on a discord call with one of my close friends. We were sending each other weird looking YouTube videos that we found, some of them hilarious and some just outright absurd. It was sort of a contest to see who could find the weirdest video just from looking at the thumbnail and title. I was going through a playlist of videos with weird Russian titles and creepy thumbnails. I randomly picked one. Boy, I sure chose the wrong one.

The video was posted in 2018 by a guy named Stuart Silverstone. He didn't have any other videos like this (or maybe he did, but they were also unlisted) posted on his channel. The video started with a weird picture of a heart zooming in on it while it shook erratically. Then it jumped to a guy hitting the head of someone who was in a canvas bag inside of a bathtub with a handgun. This footage was sped-up. The next shot was the guy lifting the head of the person in the bathtub. She (for some reason I imagine her being a woman, so I'll give her that pronoun. Same goes for the guy.) had a mask over her face, which was weird since it was already covered by the canvas bag. The mask was a red mask, and looked kind of like one of those demons in traditional Japanese art. The bathtub was also full of water now, red, presumably from the woman's blood.

If you so desire, here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K35h7dZncs&amp;feature=emb\_err\_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K35h7dZncs&amp;feature=emb_err_woyt)

The rest of the video was a bunch of cuts. It cut to a blaring red light, and then to a weird concrete wall, and back to the woman, who was now moving slightly. We get another cut the the red light, and then the screen goes black and the video's done. My friend had stopped watching after the first scene with the woman getting hit with the gun, and I can't blame him. There were numbers and letters in the description. They read as such:

34.646038, -82.453846 FQL FWZUT S YXTDZY VDBXT LXUUWF HFLMESUVC AMXSCX S RDK RUSAJ GDADWZV TWK

The numbers were coordinates, and I'll go into that in a minute, but the letters were indecipherable by my friend and I. We went to a few websites and plugged it into different ciphers, but in the end, didn't really come up with anything of meaning. The title was also a strange string of numbers:

TDSUC UMTW KXW AXTKM

We weren't able to reap anything from this, except for that the two first words came out as BLACK BOX in one of the ciphers.

After plugging in the coordinates, we found a little cabin next to a river in a town called Pelzer, SC. There wasn't much else that came from this. There was also a link in the description of the video, which I didn't click due to being scared of whatever the hell it could be. Maybe it would track me or something.

Through googling the guys name, we got lead to a website describing a cult called the ""Finders Cult"".

I'll link the website here: [https://spidercatweb.blog/the-finders-cult](https://spidercatweb.blog/the-finders-cult)

It's a weird website, with more un-decoded words and a bunch of videos that have been taken down as of now. It gave some information on the cult, but also a lot of weird nonsense.

Finally, after googling the Finders Cult, I came to a few news sites that talked about how the FBI declassified over 600 pages about a group called the Finders, a cult involved in child trafficking in the late 80's. What freaked me out is that this video was posted in 2018, and supposedly the cult was shut down long ago. Fortunately, this didn't end up affecting me in any way, but it made me wonder if the victim in the video was a child, since they're involved in child sex trafficking. Who knows. It was a really creepy, fucked up thing to find, and if anyone knows anything about it, I'd love a more in-depth explanation.

Edit: here's the FBI declassification. [https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders](https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders)

Edit 2: Here are some creepy quotes from a website I found breaking down the declassification and the website itself.

[https://finderscult.wordpress.com/](https://finderscult.wordpress.com/)

The strange men with a herd of young kids were brought in and questioned in Tallahassee and the van they traveled in was impounded. It was noted that one of the men did not cooperate at all, and when questioned appeared to go into a “trance-like state”. Questioning of the children lead to some interesting results. A lot of answers came from the oldest child Mary, as some of the younger ones were non-verbal. When asking Mary what her last name was, she replied, “Which one?” The children seemed unaware of modern technology, electricity, hot water and were curious to even the most simple contraptions such as staplers.

They did not attend school and said the men were their teachers. When asked what the men taught them, the oldest said they are taught “How to play games.” They said they lived with their mothers, although were not allowed \*inside\* of the house. They lived in the van and in tents. They traveled often, sometimes by plane. They were on a trip away to “wean” the youngest from their mothers. Officers noted that the youngest ones had no diapers on and had been taught that the ground outside was their bathroom. One apparently went potty directly on the floor in the questioning room. When asked who the leader of the group is, the oldest child had replied “the Game Caller.” When offered food, one child consumed 8 bananas and an orange. They all seemed extremely hungry.

The McMartin preschool is then documented to have many tunnels underneath it and the children were able to accurately describe entrances and exits. There were electrical switches in the school that did not work for that purpose, but rather sounded alarm alert systems. Classroom 3 contained no doorknob but solely a deadlock bolt. In the tunnels, pentagrams were found carved into the walls and on plates, along with 100 animal bones. The owner of this preschool was indicted; the trial lasted six years and then in 1993 all charges were dropped due to “lack of evidence”. In all these situations, it’s been said that no one ever ‘saw the child abuse against victims’ and therefore prosecution was ‘difficult’ to prove. 

Honestly, I could post the contents of this document and it would be a fucking creepy story in and of itself. Jesus Christ. This is REAL.

Edit 3: I've checked out his channel, and there's a playlist with some videos in it. Most are harmless, but one is by some other YouTube channel and has more weird letters in the description. Here's the link.

There are indeed a LOT of people in modern day America who were repeatedly neglected, ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected, as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, shamed, ridiculed, embarrassed, humiliated, denigrated, derogated, set up to screw up, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, vilified, dumped on, bullied, gaslighted, scapegoated, emotionally blackmailed and/or otherwise abused by others upon whom they depended for survival in the first few years of life.

Read Eric Hoffer's mid-20th century classic [*The True Believer*](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=hoffer+the+true+believer), and it becomes self-evident that this is the typical personality of those who jump on board the fast-moving freight trains of such conspiracy-obsessed and plain delusional mass movements as **German** [**National Socialism**](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=national+socialism) in the 1920s and '30s.

Adolph Hitler was himself the victim of horrid abuse by his awful father, Alois, btw. And Germany at that time was as full of people who'd become accustomed to being the elite of Europe as America full of people who've become accustomed to being the elites of the entire planet.

Couldn't answer that for sure without looking into the organizational hierarchy of any *particular* ""brand"" to see if it [operates like this](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) in a manner that meets most of the requirements set forth by the experts who put together the various lists of characteristics in [this article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html).

The control imperatives of the leaders on the upper two or three levels of each group's organizational [pyramid](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) vary considerably. Some ""hurt people hurt other people"" because, on the persecutors' [Drama Triangles](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html), victimizing others *is* imperative so that they do not have to experience *themselves* as victims.

&gt;Hello, nice to meet you  
&gt;  
&gt;I am a Falun Gong practitioner abroad  
&gt;  
&gt;My friend, I’m a Falun Gong practitioner. Because the Communist Party persecutes Falun Gong, it slanders Falun Gong, lies and makes many people misunderstand Falun Gong, so I want to tell you that Falun Dafa is Buddhism, and you will get blessings and peace if you maintain good thoughts about Buddhism. Many people hate Falun Gong because of the ""Tiananmen self-immolation."" Actually the self-immolation is fake  
&gt;  
&gt;Friends, do you know? ""Falungong has been spread in more than 100 countries. Practicing Falun Gong has improved physical health and morality. It is popular everywhere. Why is it only in China that Falun Gong is persecuted. Not in other countries in the world? Hong Kong belongs to China, though. But Falun Gong in Hong Kong is also very free. Don’t you think it’s strange?  
&gt;  
&gt;We have been clarifying the truth with you about the 20 years of persecution. I just hope you understand what good and evil is. I believe you will distinguish between good and evil, good and bad, right and wrong. Hope you calmly consider  
&gt;  
&gt;Because the history of the CCP is a history of murder, various political movements have killed countless Chinese compatriots. It is anti-god and anti-world, and it promotes atheism, But in the end will get karma. Since the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, various movements have continued one after another. Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns, the Cultural Revolution, the June 4th massacre of college students, the persecution of Falun Gong, and the harvesting of organs from Falun Gong practitioners.  
&gt;  
&gt;Did you know that the CCP always deceives the people

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: How did you add me? Do I have a group chat with you in common?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm sorry to disturb you. I just want to bring you something better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before the Wenchuan earthquake, SARS, floods and other natural disasters and man-made calamities, many kind-hearted mainland compatriots quit the party and sincerely pray “Falun Dafa is good, truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance are good”, then they escape from disaster and became safe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quitting the Communist Party is very simple. I can help you get a pseudonym and quit the CCP, the Communist Youth League, and the Young Pioneers organization. It will not affect your work and life, this is shown to the god. The god is watching you. Believe in the blessing of gods and buddhas, we can be safe when the collapse comes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quit the ccp are related to your life. I hope you will consider it calmly.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ll name you.... .*Xian Xu*.... Quit ccp, okay?  
&gt;  
&gt;Quit the CCP is related to your life.  I only want to give you safety, as long as you say ""yes"", you will be safe, you won't lose anything, God will protect you when disasters come.  
&gt;  
&gt;friend! In order to keep you safe, Please quit the CCP quickly.  As long as you agree that I will help you get a pseudonym and send it on falungong website, no need to tell the Communist organization, please select the number you want to quit and send it to me, you can double-select.

I think the whole thing was a trick to use me for unknown purposes. 

She traveled with me from Florida to California while I worked but believe it or not we were actually tracked and followed the entire time. Being tracked and followed finally ended when I ended things with her. 

There was a device installed in my car that was integrated with the GPS. It was hooked up to the stereo and was feeding us Bluetooth signals from people close by and I think it also fed signals to them. 

Was this a cult?? If so which one? 

I think she used to be a victim but is now a Willing participant in whatever that was. She said one time something about a ritual. And she was always trying to go outside around 8am and 7pm to flash weird hang signals at them. 

I’m just looking for answers. I know I’m not crazy.  

Thanks in advance

The Why: A close friend of mines suffered at the hands of an abuser (while we were children). She never mentioned this to me or anyone for that fact until we were about 15 or so(I'm 33 now). I came to realize the family member knew of the abuse but seemed to have an "" It is what it is"" attitude about it. I went with her to speak with her family members about the abuse. She confronted them but they seemed nonchalant about it. even her mother went as far as to say he (the abuser) ""is just like that sometimes"" and that she (my friend) probably wouldn't even remember it. She remembers all of it. She recalled to me a time where she was insistent on hanging out with me but ignored her to go rollerblade with some friends. it was a harmless snub to me but she was trying to get away from him. I didn't understand why she was being so insistent and it annoyed me because she didn't do the things the rest of the boys did. She knew it would get worse if she couldn't find somewhere to be while her mom was out of the house. There was a time when we were drinking and he (the abuser) caught us. it wasn't a big deal to him he knew we drank he never said anything but he'd take whatever was left and kept it for himself. But this time he hung around making inappropriate ""guy Jokes"" I laughed it off I didn't want to seem like I wasn't cool. I didn't know what to do so I just said I was too drunk and needed to go to sleep. I pretend that I was knocking out figured he'd leave because it was boring. He kept going and assaulted her. I pretended I didn't remember anything. she didn't even mention it. I was a coward because I wasn't that drunk and I knew full well there was something hugely wrong yet because she didn't mention it I used that as an excuse for me being a coward and not helping. I realized I had let her down in the worst way possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The What: I want to start a cult to help those who need a place to get away from that type of abuse. and expose those that are committing it. While most wouldn't use the term cult there are some aspect that I'm sure are illegal which are:

1. Punching and/or exposing Nazi's, Pedo's, abusive spouses And overall shitty people. 

2. Extorting said shitty people to help us find more shitty people to continue to expose and/or punch them.

3. Covering up for the ones who accomplish their goal in punching and/or exposing said shitty people. 

while these things are Morally sound IMO they certainly aren't legal. hence why this aspect is definitely  to be seriously considered before joining. while there's no forced obligation to do these things it does go a long way in establishing the trust needed to effectively grow this cult. if I receive at least 10 interested people we can form an official (secret) FB page or other platform given a positive vote by the members. also there will be lighter hearted aspects so everything isn't always so serious. Perhaps BBQ's Netflix watch Parties and just a place to exist speak without being judged. 

&amp;#x200B;

The When: I'd aim for this to be in full swing by November 11th. gives time for potential members to really think on membership go over ideas for growth and get comfortable building processes on how we should go about doing things. but id like to know what you guys and gals think.",True,False,False,cults,t5_2qzdi,59207,public,self,I WANT TO START A CULT,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/ihwn6o/i_want_to_start_a_cult/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now I want to start this because a dear friend of mines suffered at the hands of an abuser. it wasn't specifically a cult but her family members knew but didn't do anything about it. there was a ""it is what it is"" attitude about it. and the abuser was protected by the rest of the family. they said ""he's just like that sometimes"". and ""she'll be fine"" or ""she probably won't remember it"". now in spite of the very serious core of this potential cult I want there to be a much lighter aspect to it.

They marry off minors to each other through arranged marriages and crossing state lines, and hold their members under the iron grip of religious manipulation and psychological abuse. This is not all they do, the depth of the horrible things they do to people and families is too much for one post. I am 22 years old and have watched it rip my family apart.

The leader (who's name I'm not going to disclose for fear of retribution) is intelligent and entrepreneurial. He leads 8+ small businesses, with the intent of changing the world, and gets free labor from those who follow him. They act in the capacity of “students” of his unaccredited  college.

He believes he is Christ, the One Mighty and Strong, though, according to the people there, that is something that you need to have revealed to you (though they will hint at it constantly). He likes people to call him 'Father' He claims Joseph Smith came to him reborn as a man, and revealed his identity to him. (he recounts this with tears regularly).

When I was out there, there were around 150 members, most were plural wives and kids of the leader.  He had about a dozen wives when I left.

He is very charismatic, but he can be mentally and physically abusive, and will punish followers who don’t follow 'the Spirit' by his estimation. His punishments are mostly slapping and yelling, but can be pretty severe. One punishment is to adopt wives from men in the group who he deems unworthy raise a family. Because his followers believe that he is Christ reborn, they will take whatever he dishes out, and even welcome the punishment, because the alternative is to be 'cast off' forever. The few who have left, leave behind spouses and children with no hope of ever being re-united, because their loved ones still believe in Zion, and the prophet will convince them that their family is under the influence of Satan, and 'Father' is protecting them from evil.

I’m sorry that this sounds so negative, There really are many positive aspects of his group. But they are eclipsed by the manipulation and abuse. I think that he genuinely believes what he teaches, even that his punishments are meted out by the Spirit’s Righteous Anger. It would be potentially safe to visit his underground facility in Independence, or any of his business facilities. Just don’t get drawn in by the positive vibes that everyone there has.

They started attending this ""church"" back in the 90s. My uncle was a violent drug fuled maniac who would make my aunt's life a living hell. Apperantly some one from the church reached out to them and offered help. After attending the church for some time my uncle managed to turn his life around. He stopped the drugs and alcohol and started his own business.

My aunt and uncle  began to invite us to the church every sunday. Since my family was Catholic we didn't show much interest. Eventually they convinced us and we went. The church was packed and it seemed like all the devotees considered the pastor or leader as a holy man who had the power to achieve miracles. I remember him praying really hard over an old lady who was in a wheel chair. He then told her to stand up and walk. Apperantly he had the power to restore people's ability to walk. He then started passing out this type of oil that he claimed was able to relieve any pain in seconds . The service ended with a 45 minute prayer and we went home feeling a little weirded out. It was definitely different than a Catholic service.

We didn't go back for quite some time. We were again invited but this it was for a Friday service. My aunt made it clear that I should come along because it was going to teach my teenage mind a lesson. My mom thought it was a good idea since I was a teenager who was begining to rebel. We went to the church but this time only about 30 or so people showed up. I tought this was a little weird. The pastor then showed up and stated that he was going to begin the prayer that was going to conjure any demons that resided with in us. He started praying really loud and hard and about 5 or 6 people started convulsing and growling. I was freaked out. The ushers then went to each of the affected people and walked them to the front of the congregation. The pastor then ordered the ""demons"" to get on their knees with their hands behind their backs. It honestly look like they were going to be executed. He then placed one of his hands on each one of their heads and began yelling and commanding these demons to leave and never come back. The demonic people would growl and gag. Eventually the so called demons would leave and the people would praise the pastor for saving them. 
 
That service was a little too much for us and we didn't return again for a really long time. We were invited again for another ceremony and they had changed pastors. This new pastor was all about the money. He constantly asked for donations. The interesting part was that he would start at a high quantity and work his way to one dollar. He would say "" who among you has such great faith that they would like donate 500 dollars? please come up..... Anyone want to donate 400....300...200...100...50....20...10....5.....1"".
People would actually donate large sums of money. My uncle being one of those people. Through his business he donated thousands. Apperantly doing so would allow you to ""rank up"".

My uncle and aunt still attend the church. The church has a new leader apperantly. This one claims that it is okay to partake in the drinking of alcohol as long as you are not the one who buys it. How convenient right? 
I found this out on the day of his son's wedding. He had been sober for years. I wanna say at least 20. On the day of the wedding he kept nagging me to go get him a drink. I naturally thought he was joking but realized that his daughters kept giving him beer. So I bought him a bottle of wine and watched him throw 20 years out the window.

I think this ""church"" originates from Brazil or Portugal.
It used to be called ""Pare de sufrir"". This means stop your suffering"" in Spanish. They also have a logo that consists of a red heart and a dove in the middle. That's what I remember. They may have changed it.

Been struggling to move on since it is a big hole in my life. I won’t be going into specifics since I have some modest contact with people I still care about. 

I am happy to field any questions you have about the experience of growing up in a Hindu adjacent cult. Or if you are interested, some of the colourful beliefs they held and taught. 

As for me, a little detail to add context:

-	I spent a large part of my childhood in the group, well into adulthood. 
-	I did not go to any school as a child, rather we had a form of Krishna conscious home schooling (IMO didn’t amount to much). 
-	Raised vegetarian although it was more leaning towards vegan since eggs were banned. 
-	Learned to distrust the bad Karmies (Karma, actions in the world cause good or bad Karma. Karmies are people that engage in Karamic activities. Krishna consciousness is meant to break the cycle of Karma). 
-	I struggle constantly existential dread (I was taught that it was a once in a billion year chance to chant Krishna’s name else we would burn in the material world for countless lifetimes).
-	Avoided an arranged marriage. 
-	No television, music, or movies as a child.
-	Raised to be extremely misogynistic and homophobic.",True,False,False,cults,t5_2qzdi,59143,public,self,Growing up in the Hare Krishna high demand group.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/ih5fyg/growing_up_in_the_hare_krishna_high_demand_group/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will not disclose the countries or any other information because I don't want this to go into a different direction than its purpose and I also don't want to make the cause more known that it already is cause it's not worth it.

There is this woman who married a foreigner and had her kids taken away by the authorities in her ex-husband's country after their divorce because she was being abusive and she kept threatening that she would kidnap the kids and flee to her original country. The kids have their dad's nationality citizenship so CPS was not happy with the mentally unstable mother.

From that moment, she started this campaign to take her kids back, but all of her pleas have been rejected by all possible means. She was also convicted twice, once for physically attacking social workers and the other one for slander. So she is a handful.

The problem is very simple, she had her parenting rights taken away cause she is unfit to be a mother until she accepts to treat her mental illness and revise her behavior, but instead she turned her life into a social media circus, slandering the country where she still lives in, doxxing social workers and authorities (releasing personal information of people who are in charge of her case) and terrorizing the authorities. She also is not allowed to work anymore, so she is living off donations from the idiots who regard her as their Messiah. And here comes the culty part:

Crazy lady has amassed a handful of people who believe everything that she says. And I mean EVERYTHING. People believe that in one of the most civilized European countries, kids are being kept in ""cages"", starved to death and beaten up by the CPS. People believe that in said country, there are cannibal restaurants and that children are being taught in school to have sex with immigrants. All of this because she said so, no other proof. People believe absolutely any illogical thing she dares to write with her stupid hands on her stupid Facebook. **Which leads me to one of the cult signs: people will believe anything the cult leader says, without question. Those who dare to question her will be shunned, threatened and insulted.**

She presents herself as being extremely religious, fanatic even, and 80% of what she says is related to churches, God and priests. Her followers often speak of her as a ""martyr Saint"" which leads me to another cult sign: **Cult leader has some sort of connection with the divinity, or so they say.** She even had the audacity to say that her car broken down completely, but she prayed reaaaally hard and the car magically started and they made it safely to their destination. And people. Bought. It. Which takes me to my next cult sign, asking for donations. The car story had not only the purpose of showing people how much of a holy being she is, but also asking for donations to fix her magic flying car. She has several donation campaigns going on and often asks for money, and her followers happily give her whatever they can even though most of them are already poor. **Cult leaders often ask for donations as far as I am concerned.**

She says that she is a doctor and makes all of these ridiculous ""studies"" which have nothing to do with any medical knowledge, telling people to treat illnesses with garlic and that viruses don't exist. She also tells people that they can either believe in viruses or in God. And they buy her shit, and then shun those who say she is insane, because she is a ""docthurrr"". **Cult leaders often hold a position of power or some higher knowledge, and their ideas are often against the norm, it's the ""truth"".** Correct me if I'm wrong.

The thing that really concerns me is that now she told her followers to harass the authorities in her city, in her children's name. I'm not even sure that is legal or not, but besides the fact that those poor kids would want no part in this, she has no right to speak or do anything in their name, this seems to me that it's just the start. If her followers actually go on with the harassment plan, this will be her sign that she can ask them to do ANYTHING and they will happily comply. There is just one little step away from her asking them to perform terrorist attacks or just hurt people. That being paired with her constant doxxing, is very very dangerous.

No one takes her seriously, everyone just laughs at her and call her insane but no one is thinking about the handful of brainwashed idiots who are ready to do anything in her name.

I'll try to keep it brief, but I also need to elaborate in order for people to understand and offer me sound advice.

There is a ""church"" in my city that is without a doubt, a cult. I've spoken with cult experts and sociologists, as well as read lots of literature and books on the subject all have confirmed or lead me to that conclusion.   


At this point, the biggest issue is that the pastor and his wife have a very callous attitude towards the pandemic and are spreading conspiracy theories on Facebook. I am aware of the fact that this speech is protected, I don't like it, but it is. However, considering the undue influence these people have over their followers (they control relationships, what is watched/listened to, where to eat, what is allowed to be eaten, etc.), this has potential to result in a MAJOR outbreak in our city (small town Ontario, Canada).   


Aside from the Covid problems, there are major spiritual, psychological, and emotional abuses taking place. Many ex-members come out fearing hell, eternal damnation, or that they will be struck by lightening after leaving. The group of us that are investigating this church also believe that there is misappropriation of funds taking place, money scams, and that they are illegally obtaining IP addresses to identify those speaking out against them on reddit anonymously ([https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/hrwfy8/third\_day\_worship\_center/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/hrwfy8/third_day_worship_center/)). Anyone who speaks out publicly about what they suffered are subpoenaed. Three within the last few weeks have been served using their personal Facebook accounts to callout the pastor.   


These people have a lot of money, they are using the bible to manipulate and control people, and they do not care about public health and safety during the pandemic. When anyone tries to warn the city, they are served. I have contacted local politicians who told me to go to journalists. I have contacted The Fifth Estate, W5, one local news source, and nothing.

There must be something that can be done? At least regarding the Covid situation. Local citizens should NOT have to investigate a problematic group because the law is part of the group in question. Oh and I forgot to mention...THE MAYOR ALSO ATTENDS!
