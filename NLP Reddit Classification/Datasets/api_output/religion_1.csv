Why Christianity is the right religion and its texts are really the word of God?

 People can be deluded easily. Look politics for example. What if some people lied that the texts are the word of God in order to bring some order in the world? I guess that age, people were more easily deluded. So, some people with their texts, bring hope (heaven) and fear (hell). Many people believe that so, religion is created. Through years and tradition Christianity is spread.  

 What if Christianity is a man-made religion? Also, faith does not make sense to me. Faith means to believe something/someone. Its natural for people to choose NOT to believe not because its more convenient but because they ended up choosing not to believe for different reasons.

 For example, people from other religions really believe to other Gods and they are not doing it from pride. They just, really think that their religion/Gods are real!  Can you blame them for keeping their religion? NO! If an other GOd was real, would you blame yourself for being a Christian? nO! Thats the same with people who belong to other religions. So, I reach to the conclusion that having faith requires some luck and its natural for some people to believe to Jesus and some others not to.

 So, if it is natural for someone to choose not to have faith in Jesus then, I cant understand why that man deserves hell for not believing. To me maybe it seems as if Chrisitan God has allowed many paths (religions) but only one leads to heaven. But, to choose the right path(faith) requires some luck or something. Well, that does not make sense to me. The future of the soul is based on faith and somehow on luck?

Some Christians are like "" Christian God is the real God because He is"". I read messages from Muslims who told me that Allah is the real God. They really believed that like a Christian does. So, I cant blame anyone who rejects Jesus. Everyone thinks their God/Gods is the real one. I even read about a woman who I think had something like a vision and saw a Hindu God. I cant blame her for her beliefs becoming stronger after what she saw. So, my question is how Christian God expect us to have faith in Him when there are many traps/religions/delusions in these life? 

 I am not sure if this can be answered. To me it just, does not make sense. Thats why I lost my faith. Threating people that do not have faith, seems really suspicious to me. Many Christians believe to Jesus because they were taught from kids to do that. They get influenced by seeing many people (young and old) to believe in Jesus. That and the fear of hell forces them to believe to Jesus.

It is one of the most popular blessings in Hinduism, which is chanted at the end of many prayers and chants. Its alterative expressions are, sarve jana sukhino bhavantu and sarva lokah sukhino bhavantu. They mean the same.

Why Happiness Of The World?

Hindus wish for the welfare of the whole world in ritual prayers and chants for a few important reasons. They do form the core beliefs of Hindu Dharma. Hinduism is perhaps the only religion which accepts diversity as a fact of life and an expression of God and Nature, and the happiness of everyone an important consideration, if not the goal of everyone. Here are a few important reasons why the happiness of the world matters to a devout Hindu.

1. One family: Hindus believe that all the living beings on planet earth constitute one large God family (vasudaika kutumbam). If the family is happy, you are happy. Therefore, it is our duty to wish the welfare of everyone in this large family of God

2. We are not alone. Most problems arise because we see ourselves as distinct individuals, disconnected from the world. The truth is we are not alone. We are part of the web of relationships God weaves upon earth with his Maya. What effects one affects all. What you do, knowingly or knowingly, leaves its ripple effects in the world and touches many lives. You cannot be happy in a sea of unhappiness. Therefore, if you want to be happy and peaceful, you must wish for the welfare of others and contribute to their happiness.

3. Service to God. All this here is inhabited by God. All this is for God’s enjoyment only. He is in all and all are in him. Serving others is the same as serving God (manava seva Madhava seva). Therefore, when you meet others, remember that God is in them, and they deserve your love, respect and consideration. By wishing them well and treating them well, you express your love and devotion for God and do yourself a lot of good by participating in the sacrifice of life.

4. Selfishness is evil. The blessing serves as a reminder that we should not live for our happiness and welfare only, but engage in our duties for the welfare and happiness of all. As householders, it is our duty to serve others and thereby God. The Vedas affirm that selfishness is evil (adharma). Anything that you do for yourself leads to sin, suffering and rebirth. Therefore, live your life as a sacrifice for God, serving others and wishing them well.

5. Be a source of happiness rather than suffering. The world is impermanent. Everyone who lives here is subject to death, disease and aging. Mortal life is a life of suffering. No one can escape from it. Everyone is suffering. Therefore  why should we increase their suffering through our selfishness and evil actions? As long as we live, we must practice the highest virtue of nonviolence, avoiding causing suffering to others, living with self-restraint, practicing virtues, shunning the chief evils such as anger, lust, pride, envy, etc., putting others before us, serving them and wishing their welfare and happiness.

The World Means

In the context of this sacred blessing, the world means the world with which you interact every day. It mostly consists of the people and objects with which you interact. They can be your parents, grandparents, siblings, children, guests, people who seek your help, company or friendship and so on. Just as they are a part of your world, you are a part of their world too. If you can be a source of happiness to them rather than pain and suffering, you are indeed doing your part in making the world a better place to live.",True,False,False,religion,t5_2qh39,63239,public,self,Loka Samasta Sukhino Bhavantu,0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/lsnc9v/loka_samasta_sukhino_bhavantu/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of belief (agnostic) atheists often will say atheism is not a proposition, but merely a response to a theist proposition, in that they merely do not believe the proposition of theism is true. They would be correct that merely refusing p (not-accepting) the proposition of theism is true, would indeed would mean atheism is not propositional, but instead a ""psychological state of unbelief"". Ok so far so good. That is all seemingly logically consistent so far…but then that would mean if atheism is not propositional, that atheism can not be True or False since only a proposition would be T or F. 

A psychological belief is merely a mental status, not a propositional that can hold a true value. (i.e. God not existing)

This leads to two propositions:

1) Atheism is not propositional.  
2) Atheism can not be True or False.

If atheism can not be T or F, then it can not be False by conjunctive elimination:

p \^ q  
:. p

or written as:  
A and B  
Therefore A

Example:

It’s raining outside and wet.  
Therefore, it’s raining outside.

Given:

Atheism can not be True or False is logically the same as:  
“Atheism can not be True” and “Atheism can not be False”  
( \~(A v B) is logically equivalent to \~A V \~B))

Example:

A square can not have 2 or 3 sides = A square can not have 2 sides and A square can not have 3 sides.

Given: “Atheism can not be True” and “Atheism can not be False”  
Therefore, Atheism can not be True.  (conjunctive elimination)

We now have two derived propositions:

1) Atheism is not propositional.  
2) Atheism can not be True.

Both of those propositions clearly can be true but if atheism is not propositional, then 2 can’t be true (and it can’t be false either).

So if an atheist says atheism is not a proposition, but merely a response to one then you can tell them if that is the case, then atheism can not be true. If they do not then see they have have to reject at least 1 or 2 they are in a state of irrationality with an inconsistent belief system, since for 2 to be true, 1 has to be true. If they accept 1, they must accept 2…if they accept 1 and reject 2 they have an inconsistent logical system as they end up with:

1) Atheism is not propositional.  
2) Atheism can be true.

Where clearly both of these premise can not be true. If 1 is True then 2 is False and **atheism can’t be true.** 

Then, soon as you tell the lack of belief atheist that using their system of premises atheism can’t be true, the triggering usually and inevitably ensues as is often the case of having irrational incoherent systems of belief.",False,False,False,religion,t5_2qh39,63239,public,self,Atheism is a Proposition,0,[],0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/lsn6pk/atheism_is_a_proposition/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why hasn't one ever been built?

I grew up in an evangelical household. I grew up watching TBN and listening to televangelists like John Hagee or Pat Robertson or David Jeremiah or the Crough family back in the day talking about how the Jews in Israel want to built a third temple. These televangelists would do fundraisings to try and help Israel rebuilt the temple. However the problem with these televangelists is that they have a secret agenda. They want to the temple to be rebuilt because according to the Bible (or at least in a dispensationalist interpretation) in the last days there will be a third temple in Jerusalem and the Antichrist will sit in the temple and desecrate it by claiming to be God, then stuff will hit the fan and Jesus will return.

These televangelists don't want the temple rebuilt because they care about the Jews. These televangelists want the the temple rebuilt because they want the world to end.

This is used by some Christians primarily to seperate themselves from others, as an evidence of their exclusive correctness, as a foundation for their pride and ego.

But Jesus has shown us the way, it is humility and compassion, loving others by listening to them and helping them. He has given us the truth, it is love and acceptance. He has shown us how to live, through service and self sacrifice. Jesus was the Word, the Logos, the reasoned discourse. He was a symbol of sacrificial suffering at the center of a cross. He was compassion made incarnate, or so the story goes.

The point of Christ was never that we could gain immortality and comfort in some heavenly abode and look down and mock those who didn't believe like us as they suffer, all because we were fortunate enough to be born into the right cultural religion.

I think, about Jesus and think that I want Him to be real, even though following Him will be hard.

But then, I think what if He is not real? following his commands will be for nothing. I am not talking about being good etc.

I am talking about fasting, going to church, avoiding lust etc.

I am a 17 y/o guy who has always gone back and forth when it comes to belief and/or spirituality. I've always been very agnostic, meaning I don't want to deny or confirm anything, because I don't feel like I'm in a place with the right to do so. 

My family is not religious in any way, someone is maybe a little bit spiritual but that's about it. Meaning, I can't really go to someone in my family for advice about this. I'm at a place in my life where religion is on my mind, frequently. I think it is because I long for the feeling of safety and happiness that religion seems to bring people all over the world, but also because I'm at an age where I'm curious about the ""real "" world, what that is to me and what my place here is. And I'm also just very curious about the concept of belief as a whole. It feels wrong to assume that the way I currently live my life is the only right way, just because I've always been told that it is. 

But I have so many questions. What religion is right for me? How do I know? Who do I talk to about this, that will actually be able to guide me? How do I reach out to communities that can help me? And how will I know that religion is the ""right answer"" for my thoughts, versus the wrong one?

Now, I don't want what to do or what to believe. My position is that if God exists then I expect God to reach out to me, because I kept my end of the deal. That if I found what I believed to be the Truth then I would follow it with my entire heart.

I also find the premise that you need to believe in order to be saved (that when people die their default afterlife is Hell unless they practice a certain faith) also unreasonable. At this point I don't think God or something else exists because I kept my part and I never received anything back. I just want to know what is good and evil so I can choose good and avoid evil.

Some people use the terms interchangeably, some apply arbitrary labels etc. 

I wanted to bring up this discussion because I think it's worth understanding how we come to these concepts. Firstly, many religious research institutions like [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/06/more-americans-now-say-theyre-spiritual-but-not-religious/) often have a category of ""spiritual, not religious.""

This has led me to the current, and IMHO reasonable, distinction I use:

Spirituality refers to personal beliefs which are often nebulous, open-ended, and not tied to organized beliefs. Personal individualist feelings, morals and often experience override established norms of religion. 

Religion refers organized sets of beliefs, traditions, and cultural aspects that are codified to some degree, usually contain an hierarchy (priests, laity, etc) and have more structure around them. 

A lot of people however seem to refer to spirituality for smaller or lesser known beliefs that do not conform to Abrahamic beliefs—I've seen Western Polytheism, neopaganism, Shinto, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism and indigenous beliefs called spirituality, often based on an arbitrary notion of them being less organized, which is usually not always the case.

So I want to at this point instead of starting a **debate** instead have a discussion. Maybe we can all sit down and have a conversation on where each of us draws the line.

Context : I was raised in a non-religious household, with an atheist father and an agnostic mother.

I've always been somewhat skeptical of everything, more especially people and myself (even skeptical of my own day-to-day thoughts, dreams, goals, environment, fantasies, etc). 

I think I never thought too much about religion, other than what my father thought of it and of course all the bad things associated with religion through the news like terrorism. I think I naturally took the side of atheism, since most people here are also atheists.

So, somewhere along the line I became more cynical, and then increasingly so as I reached my early teen years. I questioned why everyone did the things they do - I remember being 10/11, and having one of those disco nights come up, and all I did was question the point of a disco night. I witnessed others getting excited over it and the boys and girls, of course being more tense, asking each other out to it. I would make remarks such as : 'this disco is childish, I can't believe people are taking it this seriously'. Im pretty sure it would even annoy me, even if slightly, why people would even bother caring about an event like this. But obviously I completely missed the point. 

Anyway, going off to a new school, I started to develop depression and social anxiety. I think, since I was already an atheist, and had depression, it helped me adopt a nihilistic philosophy, but I may have already been a nihilist - that there is no meaning to anything, no ultimate purpose. The depression and nihilism paired nicely, both complimenting each other. The nihilism trapped my thinking into breaking down everything into nothingness, and the depression meant I felt what I thought like (at least, I think, probably mostly) And also became Marxist without realising it, which also wasn't great for my outlook on life. 

I smoked weed and adopted a no care attitude to school and my own future. I then began to become interested in psychedelics, and then onto philosophy and other topics. This lead to my first experience of lsd, which didn't seem like a spiritual or mystical experience, even if it was one. And then 4 more times later. Not sure what happened along this time course but somewhere, something happened. What I think happened was : the LSD reset or opened my mind up - and I mean that figuratively and literally, or moved me onto the right path (I would only stay on that same path if I were wise enough, strong enough and good enough to), or maybe 'showed' me that path, or it could be said that I was shown Gods way, or that God showed me. Those toxic patterns of thoughts, those traps, were shown to me, and so can now never be forgotten. I am now agnostic, but leaning towards theism, not a nihilist, but still have tendencies towards negative thinking, depression,etc. So I have became more aware of my cynicism and thoughts disguised as rationale, I think.

But I still don't know what to do: what was bad thinking has now been revealed, but, still the truth hasn't been revealed, or maybe it has and something in me is blocking the revelation, or perhaps I am now not worthy or do not deserve, or would,by God's wisdom, not appreciate or not be able to accept the truth. I am beginning to suspect that I may never find answers to my questions, at least not by questioning. Which sounds stupid, but truth is a lot of the time revealed without even question of it; and answers are given in religious experiences.

Throughout the time, I dealt with a lot of internal conflict and confusion about my values, my religion, etc. I tried breaking up due to my uncertainties and not wanting him to put his life on hold while I'm figuring out so much of my identity. He reassured me that he understood and he wanted to be there for me and that I don't have to figure things out alone.

In the first year of dating, at an attempt at helping me figure out how I feel about religion, it turned into a biased one sided conversation about helping me see how Islam isn't real. While I was struggling with my faith, seeing him bash the religion was still hurtful and he apologized and that was the end of that. In between that time he tried to learn more about Islam. He read the Quran, tried fasting a few days in Ramadan to support me, and tried to read and watch more videos about the religion as a whole. He was starting to become a lot more open minded to it but he definitely still had his struggles.

By, the 3rd year I came to terms with my identity and figured out that I wanted to have more of an Islamic lifestyle for my future. The uncertainty of our future crept up on me again and I told him that I think we should break up because I think that my view of how I want to raise my kids might clash with his since it might be more strict than what he's used to. However, he reassured me that he was completely fine with living an Islamic lifestyle and he even said he would be fine raising our kids as such. He would want them to have a proper Islamic education from Sunday school and he's completely fine with giving up alcohol considering he doesn't even really like to drink in the first place. I gave him various scenarios and hypotheticals to see his reaction and how he would deal with them and they aligned with mine. But something in me still felt uneasy.

Unfortunately, a few days ago my parents found out about our relationship. I talked to my bf about it and he was obviously worried about what would come of things. He was frustrated that they want to control my life and didn't want me to live a life of pleasing my parents . I told him about how even before the parents I've been having an internal battle about how well we would really work out and I explained that those who make it work are those who are only ""culturally Muslim"" and not religious. I brought up evidence from the big blow out in the 1st year and some other minor example that came after and told him how it makes no sense to raise your kid an Islamic way if you don't even truly believe it. He answered that he doesn't NOT believe in it and that he agrees with the values. I told him that only means that he might respect it but he doesn't believe in it 100%. If he really did he would already consider himself a Muslim by now. His reply was that just because he wasn't an actual Muslim it doesn't mean that he can't believe in it and that while he has not converted he would not be opposed to it. To me it felt like his words were very lukewarm. However, he kept telling me I was twisting his words and not trusting him. He kept saying that it would be foolish for him to lie about something so big or not go into it without thinking because it's only going to make both of us miserable in the future. I kept asking him more scenarios to see how he would react and his views aligned with Islam. I continuously emphasized how big of commitment this is and that there's no way to half-ass the religion and he told me that he completely understood he's been thinking about this for the past 2 years and he even asked 2 converts about the situation and their experience so he fully understands the difficulties that can come with it. Right now we're on a break so I can think things over and I'm at a crossroads: given everything I just mentioned- is this practical and will he truly be capable of handling this situation or is he just speaking purely out of love and wanting to stay together and this won't be a stable enough foundation for things to last. I can't read minds and I have the tendency to overthink things or read too deeply into it so maybe he really does mean what he say fully. I just don't want us to break up if there really is a chance and after how much he's dedicated himself to learning about this. But at the same time I don't want this conversion to feel forced or for him to throw away his whole identity and value system for a girl.
