You can bring it into your mundane states of consciousness and experience it as your natural state. In Shaivism, yogis attempt to do this through yoga, mantra and tantra. According to Shaivism, beings are caught in samsara (the cycle of births and deaths), because they are filled with maya and subject to egoism, attachments and delusion, which create karma. Their consciousness is clouded, and their energies and abilities (shaktis) are limited due to the maya shaktis.

The beings who have fallen thus into their animal nature (pashu vritti) are but Shiva only in their ignorant state. The self which exists in them is pure consciousness, filled with infinite shaktis, which is also the original and pure (sahaja) state of Shiva only. However, it remains hidden due to the power of maya shaktis and does not participate in worldly activities, but remains passive as a witness.

Becoming one with that pure consciousness without duality and bringing its illumination, knowledge and potency into our wakeful, dream and deep sleep states as our essential and natural state, this is the ultimate goal of life and liberation, which Shiva yogis aim to achieve. In other words, they do not want the transcendental state of turya (blissful nonduality) to remain confined to transcendental states, but bring it into the other three states also namely jagrat (wakeful), svapna (dream) and deep sleep states and make it a continuous and uninterrupted condition of their existence upon earth.

As liberated beings (jivan muktas) they want to live in oneness or nonduality with Shiva in their mortal bodies, until they complete their time upon earth. They do not want to attain liberation or oneness with Shiva in rare moments of self-absorption or keep it confined to transcendental realm. Whether their minds and bodies are active or inactive and whether they are awake or asleep, they aim to experience it in all states and conditions as their natural (sajaja), continuous, pure and experiential state.

How can it be done? Shaivism suggests three main approaches. The first one is to be practiced keeping the main focus upon the pure consciousness of Shiva; the second one, with the help of shaktis, who are hidden in the mind and body and the universe; and the third one through persistent, self-effort. As their names imply, they are known as Shambhavopaya, Shaktopaya and Anavopaya respectively.

Of the three, the last one is considered the most difficult and inferior, and the first one the most excellent. In all the three approaches, the guidance and help of an enlightened guru are imperative since many problems can arise on the path, as the shaktis play their own tricks to prevent the escape. Sometimes, if you are lucky or if you made great progress in your past lives and earned merit and grace, Shiva may voluntarily become your divine guru and open your mind to illumination and supreme knowledge.

In Shambhavopaya, you meditate upon your essential nature as eternally indestructible, independent and infinite, pure consciousness, and try to make it your natural state by merging into it without duality or distinction. You bring that awareness not only into your wakeful state but also your dream and deep sleep states, so that your transformation as a pure being is complete in all respects and remains so in all states and conditions. It is not easy because you have to overcome your limited identity (anavatvam), which is defined and limited by your name and form and your belief that it represents your true self.

As the pure self, you have to remember constantly that you are the effulgent pure consciousness, which is eternal, infinite and indestructible, with infinite power to will (iccha shakti), know (jnana shakti) and act (kriya shakti). In your deepest aspect, you are Shiva himself, with the world as your extension and creation. You do not know it because you are veiled by a thick cloud of gross and subtle impurities. With your mind and senses and other tattvas in your body, which are instruments of maya and ruled by maya, you cannot look through them to know your true nature.


 
However, although your true nature is hidden behind a cloud of maya and you cannot see it in wakeful condition, occasionally it may manifest in you in rare moments when there is a sudden shift or opening in your consciousness and you experience strange sensations, otherworldly, psychic or mystic states. Just as the light of the sun appears through the openings in a clouded sky, these brief moments of illumination arise when the light of your pure consciousness manifests through the crevices in your wakeful or dream states, when you are lost in some activity or when your defenses are down and your mind enters a trance like reverie or condition.

Those moments may arise spontaneously or naturally in unexpected moments of quietude, or through specific yogic practices, mudras, mantras or the use of mind-altering and intoxicating substances. They are used by Shiva yogis for contemplation to cultivate equanimity and grow nearness to the pure self which is hidden in them. Contemplating upon them and upon the nature and consciousness of Shiva, they dissolve their limited selves in its knowledge and illumination and become absorbed in it. Once they experience the awakening (Bhairava udyama) in a state of nonduality, they gradually bring its light and bliss into their wakeful consciousness and become stabilized in it.

There are other practices which produce similar results. For example, you can create an opening in your consciousness by freezing you mind when you are about to jump from thought to another or by remaining focused upon the silence which arises in the small space between one thought and another or between one activity or modification of the mind and another. You can use them as the doorways to enter the supreme state of your pure self.

Yogis also try to access the ocean of pure consciousness by meditating upon blissful states which they may occasionally experience during mundane activities such as eating, drinking, sleeping, etc. The pleasure or happiness which you experience in your body in your wakeful state is but a faint form of the transcendental bliss of turya only. By meditating upon it, you can open your mind and bring the illumination of your blissful, pure consciousness into your wakeful and dream states.

These experiences grow in intensity and the illumination of pure consciousness begin to manifest frequently in your consciousness, as you engage in self-purification, invoking the shaktis who are hidden in your mind, body, speech, breath, nadis, intelligence and consciousness. Since the same shaktis are also hidden in creation in various aspects as sacred sounds, mantras and letters, names and forms, etc., yogis contemplate upon them to awaken them within themselves. They harness their power to transform their minds and bodies so that they become the living embodiments of Shiva.

Thus, by purifying their minds and bodies with pure shaktis, and removing the clouds that surround them, yogis drown themselves in the bliss of pure consciousness. Pure and blemishless, they become the lord of their shaktis and develop many siddhis. Pure knowledge (sahaja vidya) which is natural to them manifests in them as the illumination of their pure nature and spreads into their being and consciousness as they become firmly established in the supreme state of Shiva himself, which is nondual, self-existent, independent and blissful. As they remain so in all the four states of consciousness namely jagrat, svapna, susupta and turya with firm control over the shaktis, they develop immense power. When the transformation is complete, they go beyond turtya (turyatita) which is indescribable and inexplicable.

 I prayed and tried to explain that I do not want to make promsies and I make them because of my ocd. I tried to make clear that a real promise would count only if I understand what I am trying to do, if I mean it and if I validate the promise by doing the cross sign 3 times. I just, tried to seperate real promises from ocd promises that I was using to fight my ocd and find some relief from anxiety.

 Due to ocd, I ended up kissing the door from a church and tried to lick it (due to ocd). I started worrying that maybe I will be punished for putting saliva in the door. I think, I bought a bottle of water and used some of it on my t-shirt and used it to clean the door. It was a period that my ocd got worse. I was having the fear of a specific curse from God.

 I think, the next day or a day near the next, ocd wanted me to repeat the same compulsion. I think, I hesitated but in the end, I rushly, did it. I starteed worrying. I started thinking that I may have made a promise to Christian God not to do it again or something like that and that maybe I asked for that specific curse in case breaking the promise. 

 It was probably, an hypothesis. Until this day, I cant remember making such a promise. I think, I would not dare to make that promise and later, forget it. Maybe there could have been some intrusive thoughts due to anxiety, but I higly, doubt that I tried to mean such a promise and then, validate it. I worry because I worried that moment (2.5 years ago). What if I made such a promise, validated it and then, forgot it but my subconscious remembered it? Why I felt so bad? What if other Gods accepted the hypothetical promise if in case CHristian God is not real? What if They accepted the promise?

 I was in a state that I did not want to make promises but I worry that due to anxiety, I may have been forced by my ocd to make one and tried to valdiate it because I thought that it will save me from anxiety.

I think. there were times that I tried to avoid kissing that spot (because it could have been rust) but ocd was telling me stuff like:

ocd: you are not trusting God?

or something like that.so, I was forced to kiss the spot that I did not want. I remember while doing the same compulsion, I kissed that spot but I did it rushly, because deep down I was afraid that it may be bad to kiss that spot, if in case it was rust. My ocd started telling me stuff like:

- ocd: by kissing it so fast may count as a mockery to God. You need to prove to God that you are kissing it with no fear or rush.

So, I kissed it again and I tried to lick it etc. (I am not trolling) Ocd started giving me new worry, like

- ocd: you left your saliva on the door. you must clean it because you may be punished with what you fear.

I think, I bought a bottle of water, put some in my t-shirt and cleaned that spot. I think, thats all I remember from that day.I think, the next day or probably, a day near the next, I wanted to go for a run and ocd told me something like:

- ocd: you better do the usual compulsion on that church.


I was in a good mood that day (2,5 years ago) and I did not want to argue with my ocd. So, I want outside from that church and did the cross sign 3 times, I think and then, I was about to do the second compulsion (kiss the door) and I think, something felt wrong as if I should not do it. I needed to make a choice because I did not want to analyze it and get more anxious. So, I kissed the door and maybe, tried again to lick it etc.

 I started getting very worried. I started worrying that the last time I did that compulsion, after cleaning it, I may have made a promise to Christian God not to do it again or something like that. I worried that I may have made the promised, and asked for a specific punishment in case breaking it to make sure that I will never repeat the compulsion. I used to make promises in order to force myself, using the fear of the punishment, not to do ocd compulsions. I cant remember making that promise but I remember worrying too much about it.

 Before that, in the past, I prayed to Christian God and tried to make clear that I do not want promises and that were made because of my ocd. I tried to make clear that a promise would only count only if I understand what I was trying to do, if I would mean it and if I would validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times.

 Τhat night, in which, I cleaned the door using my t-shirt, I cant remember making any promise. Maybe I had some random, intrusive thoughts due to anxiety but I cant remember validating a promise and I think, I would not dare. But, what if I was so anxious that I tried to make a real promise and validated it and then, forgot it? Why I felt so anxious when I did the same compulsion?

But, what if, I was so anxious by my ocd that I tried to make and mean those promiseS?

 The punishment that I fear is invisible. I will give you a similar example maybe. Lets say that someone makes a promise to Gods and as for a punishment he asks to become bald and unable to see the baldness. When he looks in the mirror, he sees his normal hair but in reality, he is bald and all others can see it except him.I worry about something similar. Is this rational? what if Gods do not care about my ocd? what if there is a secret rule that whoever asks for a punishment for breaking a promise, he gets what he asked as a punishment?

 Also, I have other worries and fears. I am thinking about the simulation theory. Why there are so many people that write their experiences in a reddit site? Could it be that they all are liars or mistaken? I think, some experiences are similar like, teleporting cats, vanishing items, people appearing out of nowhere etc

 So, I am a guy with ocd and many fears and worries and what ifs. What if I should be Christian? What if Jesus is not real? What if we are in a matrix? What if my ocd is right? What if I broke a promise? What if I got punished? What if I need to live a more Christianic life? What if I should stop doing stuff that I enjoy? all that make my ocd worse, my anxiety worse and my depression worse. I do not know what to believe. Also, I read/hear opinions from atheists or agnostics and I think, I get influenced. I cant be the Christian who will read the Bible and say that I believe. I cant be the Christian who always thinks what if Christianity is a manmade religion and the Bible is written by liars? Why I should reject the Qur'An  but accept the Bible?

 I am getting angry with myself, my ocd and maybe with life. Sometimes, I think that Christian God created us, put us into a sinful world of pain, allowed many delusions in life such as other religions, supernatural events, maybe after life experiences, made us to have urges and created rules that may be burden to some people and want us to follow the right path while in our world there are these which I mentioned.",True,False,False,religion,t5_2qh39,61803,public,self,"Irrational fear, what ifs, depression",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/l6xpmk/irrational_fear_what_ifs_depression/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 I worry about breaking hypothetical promises to Christian God in which I maybe have asked for a specific punishment in case breaking them. I cant remember making them but I have a bad feeling as if I maybe made those promises.

 What if Christian God is not real and other Gods accepted the promise? What if I broke them? What if They punished me with the way I was forced to ask because of my ocd? I did not want to make promises and probably, never made because I cant remember. But, what if, I was so anxious by my ocd that I tried to make and mean those promiseS?

 The punishment that I fear is invisible. I will give you a similar example maybe. Lets say that someone makes a promise to Gods and as for a punishment he asks to become bald and unable to see the baldness. When he looks in the mirror, he sees his normal hair but in reality, he is bald and all others can see it except him.

 I worry about something similar. Is this rational? what if Gods do not care about my ocd? what if there is a secret rule that whoever asks for a punishment for breaking a promise, he gets what he asked as a punishment?

 Also, I have other worries and fears. I am thinking about the simulation theory. Why there are so many people that write their experiences in a reddit site? Could it be that they all are liars or mistaken? I think, some experiences are similar like, teleporting cats, vanishing items, people appearing out of nowhere etc

https://old.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/

 I was raised as a Christian but all that and some other doubts make it difficult for me to follow Jesus. And also, when I read or think about Christianity, I found some things that give me anxiety.

 For example, I read 1 Corinthians 5:11 and I worry that I maybe need to stop enjoying the company of my friends because some are agnostics.

 So, I get more anxious and frustrated with everything in life. Ocd tells me:

ocd: do not do that! do this!

Christians on reddit tell me

Christians: Do not do this. do this! etc etc
 

 So, I am a guy with ocd and many fears and worries and what ifs. 

What if I should be Christian? What if Jesus is not real? What if we are in a matrix? What if my ocd is right? What if I broke a promise? What if I got punished? What if I need to live a more Christianic life? What if I should stop doing stuff that I enjoy?

all that make my ocd worse, my anxiety worse and my depression worse. I do not know what to believe. Also, I read/hear opinions from atheists or agnostics and I think, I get influenced.

 I cant be the Christian who will read the Bible and say that I believe. I cant be the Christian who always thinks what if Christianity is a manmade religion and the Bible is written by liars? Why I should reject the Qur'An  but accept the Bible?

I also know that even in established religions, individual believers are each following their own interpretations and beliefs within the umbrella of said religion.

But I'm wondering how people here would feel about someone who creates their own religion (either as a syncretization of existing beliefs or something entirely new they come up with) that no one else follows besides them.

I know that the most common objection would be that it defeats the purpose of religion by being so centered on individualism, when most people see religion as an inherently communal activity. It seems to me that this fits in to the wider debate on the differences between ""religion"" and ""spirituality"", where ""religion"" is seen as communal while ""spirituality"" is individual.

Personally, I don't think there's much difference between religion and spirituality, if any. People who identify as ""spiritual but not religious"" still often form communities with people who believe similar things, either on the basis of religion or other factors like class, politics, etc. Likewise, ""organized religion"" is infamous for its struggles with individual interpretation leading to multiple congregational splits into smaller and smaller groups.

But I feel like I'm getting sidetracked. What I'm curious about is, how would y'all feel about someone who invents a religion entirely for themselves that no one else follows but them?

Also, I'm curious if there's anybody who's done something like that before.

Organized by and Venue:  International Institute of Islamic Thought and  Civilization - International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC- IIUM)
 
Rationale:
Malaysia is a multicultural country where Islam is the official religion with Muslims co-existing with people of other faiths for centuries and with Buddhism being the largest minority religion spread all over the country.

As an institute of advanced studies and research the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization, International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC-IIUM) is committed to cultivate and develop intercultural dialogue and understanding between religions and civilisations as area of academic study, research and building of living cooperation between communities. The objective is to enhance intercultural understanding and foster civilizational dialogue between communities living in Malaysia and across nations.  This objective of ISTAC-IIUM corresponds with the goal number 16 of the UN’s Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of building Peace and Justice Strong Institutions. The proposed “National Conference On Rahma and Karuna - Compassion As Common Ground For Building Understanding Between Of Islam And Buddhism” is aimed at developing a deep sense of social responsibility among its staff and students and in Malaysia.

Islam-Buddhism relations are also crucial for building and sustaining robust, dynamic and peaceful ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community marked with hallmarks of building understanding, co-existence and dialogue. The blueprint of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) instrument of the ASEAN Organization calls for the building of people-oriented and socially responsible solidarity and unity among the peoples of ASEAN for the well-being of the region.

Buddhism and Islam are the two major ASEAN religions, Muslims make up about 42% and the Buddhists about 40% population of ASEAN community. In light of emerging Asian Islamophobia and mutual disinformation about Islam and Buddhism between the followers of these religions living either as majorities or minorities in Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, there is the urgent need to undertake efforts to build Islam-Buddhism understanding and dialogue to reinforce unity and mutual respect between the Muslims and the Buddhists in  Malaysia whose positive outcomes will spread to other countries in the region. Especially, as we are all facing the COVID19 pandemic and rising Muslim-Buddhist tensions and conflicts verging towards violence.
The fostering of Buddhism-Islam relation of understanding through nurturing of the human, cultural and natural resources for sustained development has now become an urgent need for moving beyond the  currently negative state of relations between followers of the two religions in Malaysia and also Buddhist and Muslim majority and minority countries.
The Quran recognizes and respects diversity of religions and also calls for building common ground for building peaceful coexistence.

In Sqyemitic languages of Hebrew and Arabic, compassion are known as rahamanut and rahman, respectively referring to rehem-womb in reference to mother/child or maternal affection representing being unselfish, unconditional altruism or love also caring and need to care.  

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among Allah’s attributes are mercy and compassion or in the canonical language of Arabic, Rahman and Rahim.
The Quranic term Rahma – denotes kindness, benevolence, benefits God gives to humanity. And it also refers to gentleness, kindness and empathetic sensitivity which humans should have in their relationships with each other as individuals and communities.

Each of the 114 chapters of the Qur’an, with one exception, begins with the verse, ""In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful,"" The Arabic word for compassion is rahmah. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e. by reciting Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim. And Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is described in the  Qur’an as a personification of the practice of compassionate behavior towards all living beings – human and non-human.
 
And We have not sent you (Muhammad) but as a mercy to the worlds. Qur'an  20:107
 
O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). Qur'an  40:13  
 
For every one of you we appointed a law and a way. And if God had pleased He would have made you a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you. So compete one with another in virtuous deeds. To God you will all return, so He will inform you of that wherein you differed… Qur'an 5:48
 
For the Buddha, the purpose of life is to foster karuna - compassion and welfare of all beings, with care, consideration and rightful living.
 
Monks, there is one person whose birth into the world is for the welfare of many folk, for the happiness of many folk; who is born out of compassion for the world, for the profit, welfare and happiness of devas and mankind. Who is that one person? It is a Tathāgata who is Arahant, a fully Enlightened One. Anguttara Nikaya
 
If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if  he does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law (Dhamma), and, is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of that mindful person steadily increase.  Dhammapada Verse 24
 
He is not a wise man just because he talks much; only he who is peaceful, free from enmity, and does no harm to others, is called  ' a wise man'.  Dhammapada Verse 258
 
Karuna -in Sanskrit and Pāli, means “compassion,” or “empathy”; the wish that others be free from suffering, the wish that others be happy. It is one of the forty topics of meditation, compassion is used for the cultivation of tranquility Compassion is to be developed by filling one’s mind with kindheartedness, including acknowledging the kindness one has received from other beings in past lifetimes.

Organized by and Venue:  International Institute of Islamic Thought and  Civilization - International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC- IIUM)
 
Rationale:
Malaysia is a multicultural country where Islam is the official religion with Muslims co-existing with people of other faiths for centuries and with Buddhism being the largest minority religion spread all over the country.

As an institute of advanced studies and research the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization, International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC-IIUM) is committed to cultivate and develop intercultural dialogue and understanding between religions and civilisations as area of academic study, research and building of living cooperation between communities. The objective is to enhance intercultural understanding and foster civilizational dialogue between communities living in Malaysia and across nations.  This objective of ISTAC-IIUM corresponds with the goal number 16 of the UN’s Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of building Peace and Justice Strong Institutions. The proposed “National Conference On Rahma and Karuna - Compassion As Common Ground For Building Understanding Between Of Islam And Buddhism” is aimed at developing a deep sense of social responsibility among its staff and students and in Malaysia.

Islam-Buddhism relations are also crucial for building and sustaining robust, dynamic and peaceful ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community marked with hallmarks of building understanding, co-existence and dialogue. The blueprint of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) instrument of the ASEAN Organization calls for the building of people-oriented and socially responsible solidarity and unity among the peoples of ASEAN for the well-being of the region.

Buddhism and Islam are the two major ASEAN religions, Muslims make up about 42% and the Buddhists about 40% population of ASEAN community. In light of emerging Asian Islamophobia and mutual disinformation about Islam and Buddhism between the followers of these religions living either as majorities or minorities in Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, there is the urgent need to undertake efforts to build Islam-Buddhism understanding and dialogue to reinforce unity and mutual respect between the Muslims and the Buddhists in  Malaysia whose positive outcomes will spread to other countries in the region. Especially, as we are all facing the COVID19 pandemic and rising Muslim-Buddhist tensions and conflicts verging towards violence.
The fostering of Buddhism-Islam relation of understanding through nurturing of the human, cultural and natural resources for sustained development has now become an urgent need for moving beyond the  currently negative state of relations between followers of the two religions in Malaysia and also Buddhist and Muslim majority and minority countries.
The Quran recognizes and respects diversity of religions and also calls for building common ground for building peaceful coexistence.

In Sqyemitic languages of Hebrew and Arabic, compassion are known as rahamanut and rahman, respectively referring to rehem-womb in reference to mother/child or maternal affection representing being unselfish, unconditional altruism or love also caring and need to care.  

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among Allah’s attributes are mercy and compassion or in the canonical language of Arabic, Rahman and Rahim.
The Quranic term Rahma – denotes kindness, benevolence, benefits God gives to humanity. And it also refers to gentleness, kindness and empathetic sensitivity which humans should have in their relationships with each other as individuals and communities.

Each of the 114 chapters of the Qur’an, with one exception, begins with the verse, ""In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful,"" The Arabic word for compassion is rahmah. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e. by reciting Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim. And Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is described in the  Qur’an as a personification of the practice of compassionate behavior towards all living beings – human and non-human.
