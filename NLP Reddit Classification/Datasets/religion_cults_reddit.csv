My dad had a bookmark with some version of the Golden Rule from about 10 religions. Such similarities seem superficial to me. 

Comparing religions at a deeper level suggests to me religions are fundamentally different. 

Religions start with a view of the human condition.  

- Christianity claims the original couple fell from perfection into sin which all subsequent humans  inherit. 

- Islam claims all humans are born good, not sinful. 

- Buddhism claims all humans suffer and die and we keep coming back over and over to do it again.  

These are not fundamentally the same human condition. Each religion's response to the human condition is fundamentally different. 

I would like the read why/how religions are fundamentally the same. I am not going to argue with posters. I am going to just shut up and read the responses. 

Thanks in advance."

religion,lu3474,Women in the Priesthood- what is the real reason why?,"I am trying to understand this as a broader historical trend (why women were denied the priesthood in Judaism, Catholicism, Mormonism, and many other religions, why women were denied the vote), and all of the rationalizations across instances are pretty obvious to me to be propaganda and system  justification (appeals to authority of tradition, Jesus had only male disciples, women are already ""more divine/righteous than men""), but I also think ""because Patriarchy"" lacks a little nuance as a counter argument. I really want to get to the bottom of it, but it's a really complex line of inquiry with little to no good sources.

One of the real (meaning probably largely unconscious) reasons may be that women in leadership positions tend to be more concerned with the equitable distribution of resources. I think that's something built into us from waaay back into hunter/gatherer days. Growth for growth's sake and ever  increasing acquisition of resources seem to be more of the Male concern of power; conquest, conversion, bodies in pews and missionaries out in the third world. You need a lot of capital to keep expanding empire.

I  think the other aspect of it has to do with sexuality/reproduction. Giving women power gives them greater power of choice in sexual selection. When women do not have power, more males of any generation will go on to reproduce. When women do have power, a greater portion of males wind up sexually dispossessed. Disaffected males trend toward hyper violence, as a high-risk, high-reward strategy for attaining status and earning mates.

So giving women power may have some destabilizing effects on society across wider time spans. This may have likely happened several times in the past, and that period of destabilization may have left some societies vulnerable to outside forces and wiped them out before they could reintegrate. We may have collectively learned that doing so was unsustainable (given various environmental/historical circumstances at the time) or at the very least  risky, and this became codified as the general trend of tradition and authority to keep women out, even if the actual reasons why were never rationally known or articulated. The last bit is pure speculation, but even if true, I don't think that means that it will always in every instance be true. Maybe these complex social structures have to reach a certain level of growth and stability and security against predation before even being able to grant women power and allowing a values shift toward equity and away from expansion.

Anyway, it's way above my intellectual pay-grade, and the Big Guy isn't giving me any hints. But I'd rather use the reason God gave me than listen to those  who claim to speak for Him... although that is my personal bias (and often a handicap) and I mean no offense lol."

Hey Guys, this video covers the hidden meanings of the song, ""That Green Gentleman"" by Panic! At The Disco.

It's a song about healing from the ego identity, nirvana, and the one mind that projects the universe. The Green Gentleman represents the part of our mind that recognizes truth from illusion and is responsible for waking us up from the dream when we are ready to hear it.

With lyrics such as, ""I'm someone I've never met"" ""I wanna go where everyone feels the same"" and ""I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her, now I'm the only one to blame"" the Non-Dualistic symbolism of the lyrics becomes clear.

We are someone we've never met with our ego identities. We are the one mind that believes it's separate from source, and more truthfully, the one mind that's NOT separate from source. Nirvana, Heaven, or Source is where everyone is and feels the same. It's our true home. We never admitted we missed this home, where everyone and everything still is, and instead perpetuated the ego thought system to create scapegoats for our perceived guilt over our belief we separated. The ego survives by blaming others for this inner guilt that we displace out of our awareness, but the onus is on us to finally take that responsibility for our own feelings.

religion,lsxdc7,A polytheists critique of monotheism,"I've been thinking about this for a long time but I've never gotten a response from actual monotheists. So here's my problem: Monotheist religions like Christianity claim that God is outside creation because he is the foundation of creation itself. This is ultimately a contradiction. First, let's define terms. A god is a personal deity that can be petitioned to act in benevolence on our behalf. The word god comes from the PIE ǵʰutós meaning ""invoked one"", thus by definition a god must be able to be prayed to. To be prayed to a god must consist of a personality, otherwise, it's like petitioning gravity to act on your behalf. A personality must be able to be defined even if the definition is unknown or unknowable. Good and evil or benevolence and malevolence can be defined as that which promotes being and that which promotes nonbeing respectively. If anything can be defined as good it's being because otherwise, no subsequent action can occur and as evil is the antithesis of good it can therefore be defined as being's opposite, thus if we presuppose the existence of good and evil we must therefore accept this basic definition.

So now we must ask ourselves what is the foundation of creation itself. This must be something that is a prerequisite to existence, in other words, some force or forces which cannot be broken down any further and without which nothing can exist. This can only be the states of being, nonbeing, and potential. That which exists is in a state of being, that which does not yet exist is in a state of nonbeing, and that which is coming into or out of existence is in a state of potential. As these forces are pre-required for something to be or even not be, they were not created and thus have no beginning. As nothing could exist or even not exist without them, they have no end either and cannot be destroyed. Thus they are infinite in their eternity.

Now, in order to prove monotheism, we must apply the quality of a god to this foundation. However, here's where we run into our issue. As I established previously, a personality must be able to be defined. However an infinite cannot be defined as in breaking it up you're making it finite and thus no longer an infinity. An example of this as well as it's own problem is that if the foundation of creation is being, nonbeing, and potential and God \*is\* that foundation then God must therefore promote being, nonbeing, and potential simultaneously. Given our earlier established definition of good and evil, this means that God must be simultaneously good, evil, and indifferent. This violates the law of contradiction. The only way to resolve this is to create separate personalities for being, nonbeing, and potential but this is polytheism. Alternatively, I suppose you could create some sort of trinity (which is polytheism in denial) but this would not be the trinity of the bible with a father, son, and holy spirit but something closer to Hinduism with a creator, preserver, and destroyer.

So, yeah. This seems stupidly simple and I can't imagine I'm the first person to think of it so if anyone has a counterargument I'd love to hear it."
religion,lsxb1g,Did the Abrahamic god gives us the choice to be created?,"What i mean by that is in most Abrahamic religions this life is a test. Pass the test and you will go to heaven, fail the test and you will go to hell. So did God gave us the chose to participate in the test and its rules before we were created. If we accept the challenge we will forget our promise with god and if we refused to participate in the test we be cease to exist with no punishment or reward. 

If god gave us the choice to be created and undergo the test of this life, then this will solve the problem of evil and other theological problem on the fairness in the day of judgement. 

Do you think this is probable and does christianity, Jewdism and islam mentioned something like that."
religion,lsw30j,The Real Meaning of the Garden of Eden,"The Garden of Eden is one of the most misunderstood passages in the history of the Bible. When it comes to knowledge of good and evil, it is the divine knowledge of good and evil. There was no other. Is God’s knowledge of good and evil a purely cognitive knowledge? Where does He look at good and evil, recognize that good is good and evil is evil? No. **He determines good and evil**. So, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is not knowing how some things are bad and others are good — if it were this sense it would be absolutely self-contradictory.  


If the knowledge of good and evil were only to know good and evil, that would be incompatible with the idea of God giving them an order. If God has given a commandment, it is clear that obeying the commandment is good and disobeying it is evil. So, God cannot give an order and, at the same time, forbid the guys from knowing good and evil (in the human sense of this knowledge). **So it is obviously not a question of this — of mere discernment**. God cannot forbid them (Adam and Eve) to know good and evil and then complain because they listened to the serpent… This cannot be the point.  


**It is divine knowledge, therefore the ability to determine by its very nature what is good and evil**  


On the contrary, man cannot do this, he lives within a field where there is good and evil predetermined by God; this knowledge he can have, what he cannot have is divine knowledge and that is why it is said that the tree of good and evil was at the center of paradise. So what did they try to do? Usurping the divine authority to determine good and evil… God does not arbitrarily determine good and evil, but according to the expression of His nature.  


You are not forbidden to know the truth humanly or to know good and evil (humanly). **You are prohibited from trying to be the cause of all things and the generating factor of good and evil**, which is exactly what modern culture is trying to do by saying that “good and evil is your choice. There is no morally condemning act… They are cultural creations, etc.”  


Now, if you understand that the prohibition against touching the tree of good and evil is a prohibition of knowledge, then you will fall into the Gnostic interpretation — that God made Adam and Eve two idiots (who could not know anything) and that from there came the saving serpent and showed them the horizon of knowledge. They had no precedent for human knowledge of good and evil; only God knew good and evil. So, if it didn’t have a human precedent, it could only be divine knowledge.  


The knowledge of good and evil is not a discernment operated by conscience, but the controversial action of trying to obtain that knowledge in a self-sufficient way. When God commanded Adam not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen 2: 17), He respectfully positioned human freedom as the sole parameter of discernment between good and evil, not mattering that actually eating the fruit of the said tree would contain some kind of cosmic revelation. Not even the tempting serpent identified itself with “evil”, it just exploited the intelligence of Adam and Eve saying: “You will be like gods” (Genesis 3: 5), revealing what actually drove original sin, and which was less a lie than a suggestion. Once the effects of sin were released, man remained ignorant of the nature of evil until the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, who alone became aware of good and evil on the Cross, when the fruit returned to the tree, man became the image of God and the evil of man was redeemed, but still, without any intervention of human intelligence."
religion,lsvv96,We can do very little with religion... But we can do nothing without it!,"  

While we understand that religion is only a kindergarten to spirituality, while we know that with religion, we can never realize God, we should not believe that religion is insignificant. While we can do little with it, we can do nothing without it. We need religion to progress on our journey of spirituality. We need religion to teach us that God exists. It is religion that helps us believe in God, to live with faith, hope, trust and enthusiasm. However, if we only stick to our religion, and don't go beyond to the university of spirituality, we will never realize God. Religion makes us go round and round in circles in our belief in God, and eventually we die. Spirituality makes us go within to realize God and become one with God."
religion,lsumcw,What religion views this as the story of creation?,[deleted]
religion,lstjaw,Having Faith Seems Suspicious To Me," There many religions besides CHristianity and there are other texts too. Why Christianity is the right religion and its texts are really the word of God?

 People can be deluded easily. Look politics for example. What if some people lied that the texts are the word of God in order to bring some order in the world? I guess that age, people were more easily deluded. So, some people with their texts, bring hope (heaven) and fear (hell). Many people believe that so, religion is created. Through years and tradition Christianity is spread.  

 What if Christianity is a man-made religion? Also, faith does not make sense to me. Faith means to believe something/someone. Its natural for people to choose NOT to believe not because its more convenient but because they ended up choosing not to believe for different reasons.

 For example, people from other religions really believe to other Gods and they are not doing it from pride. They just, really think that their religion/Gods are real!  Can you blame them for keeping their religion? NO! If an other GOd was real, would you blame yourself for being a Christian? nO! Thats the same with people who belong to other religions. So, I reach to the conclusion that having faith requires some luck and its natural for some people to believe to Jesus and some others not to.

 So, if it is natural for someone to choose not to have faith in Jesus then, I cant understand why that man deserves hell for not believing. To me maybe it seems as if Chrisitan God has allowed many paths (religions) but only one leads to heaven. But, to choose the right path(faith) requires some luck or something. Well, that does not make sense to me. The future of the soul is based on faith and somehow on luck?

Some Christians are like "" Christian God is the real God because He is"". I read messages from Muslims who told me that Allah is the real God. They really believed that like a Christian does. So, I cant blame anyone who rejects Jesus. Everyone thinks their God/Gods is the real one. I even read about a woman who I think had something like a vision and saw a Hindu God. I cant blame her for her beliefs becoming stronger after what she saw. So, my question is how Christian God expect us to have faith in Him when there are many traps/religions/delusions in these life? 

 I am not sure if this can be answered. To me it just, does not make sense. Thats why I lost my faith. Threating people that do not have faith, seems really suspicious to me. Many Christians believe to Jesus because they were taught from kids to do that. They get influenced by seeing many people (young and old) to believe in Jesus. That and the fear of hell forces them to believe to Jesus. What if Christianity is just a false religion that became  a tradition and caused brainwashing to people?"

religion,lsnc9v,Loka Samasta Sukhino Bhavantu,"Loka Samasta Sukhino Bhavantu means may the whole world by happy. It is one of the most popular blessings in Hinduism, which is chanted at the end of many prayers and chants. Its alterative expressions are, sarve jana sukhino bhavantu and sarva lokah sukhino bhavantu. They mean the same.

Why Happiness Of The World?

Hindus wish for the welfare of the whole world in ritual prayers and chants for a few important reasons. They do form the core beliefs of Hindu Dharma. Hinduism is perhaps the only religion which accepts diversity as a fact of life and an expression of God and Nature, and the happiness of everyone an important consideration, if not the goal of everyone. Here are a few important reasons why the happiness of the world matters to a devout Hindu.

1. One family: Hindus believe that all the living beings on planet earth constitute one large God family (vasudaika kutumbam). If the family is happy, you are happy. Therefore, it is our duty to wish the welfare of everyone in this large family of God

2. We are not alone. Most problems arise because we see ourselves as distinct individuals, disconnected from the world. The truth is we are not alone. We are part of the web of relationships God weaves upon earth with his Maya. What effects one affects all. What you do, knowingly or knowingly, leaves its ripple effects in the world and touches many lives. You cannot be happy in a sea of unhappiness. Therefore, if you want to be happy and peaceful, you must wish for the welfare of others and contribute to their happiness.

3. Service to God. All this here is inhabited by God. All this is for God’s enjoyment only. He is in all and all are in him. Serving others is the same as serving God (manava seva Madhava seva). Therefore, when you meet others, remember that God is in them, and they deserve your love, respect and consideration. By wishing them well and treating them well, you express your love and devotion for God and do yourself a lot of good by participating in the sacrifice of life.

4. Selfishness is evil. The blessing serves as a reminder that we should not live for our happiness and welfare only, but engage in our duties for the welfare and happiness of all. As householders, it is our duty to serve others and thereby God. The Vedas affirm that selfishness is evil (adharma). Anything that you do for yourself leads to sin, suffering and rebirth. Therefore, live your life as a sacrifice for God, serving others and wishing them well.

5. Be a source of happiness rather than suffering. The world is impermanent. Everyone who lives here is subject to death, disease and aging. Mortal life is a life of suffering. No one can escape from it. Everyone is suffering. Therefore  why should we increase their suffering through our selfishness and evil actions? As long as we live, we must practice the highest virtue of nonviolence, avoiding causing suffering to others, living with self-restraint, practicing virtues, shunning the chief evils such as anger, lust, pride, envy, etc., putting others before us, serving them and wishing their welfare and happiness.

The World Means

In the context of this sacred blessing, the world means the world with which you interact every day. It mostly consists of the people and objects with which you interact. They can be your parents, grandparents, siblings, children, guests, people who seek your help, company or friendship and so on. Just as they are a part of your world, you are a part of their world too. If you can be a source of happiness to them rather than pain and suffering, you are indeed doing your part in making the world a better place to live."
religion,lsn6pk,Atheism is a Proposition,"I saw a reddit post 2 years ago with this title and it seems people didn't understand this so here I'll drop this here to logically explain this:

Lack of belief (agnostic) atheists often will say atheism is not a proposition, but merely a response to a theist proposition, in that they merely do not believe the proposition of theism is true. They would be correct that merely refusing p (not-accepting) the proposition of theism is true, would indeed would mean atheism is not propositional, but instead a ""psychological state of unbelief"". Ok so far so good. That is all seemingly logically consistent so far…but then that would mean if atheism is not propositional, that atheism can not be True or False since only a proposition would be T or F. 

A psychological belief is merely a mental status, not a propositional that can hold a true value. (i.e. God not existing)

This leads to two propositions:

1) Atheism is not propositional.  
2) Atheism can not be True or False.

If atheism can not be T or F, then it can not be False by conjunctive elimination:

p \^ q  
:. p

or written as:  
A and B  
Therefore A

Example:

It’s raining outside and wet.  
Therefore, it’s raining outside.

Given:

Atheism can not be True or False is logically the same as:  
“Atheism can not be True” and “Atheism can not be False”  
( \~(A v B) is logically equivalent to \~A V \~B))

Example:

A square can not have 2 or 3 sides = A square can not have 2 sides and A square can not have 3 sides.

Given: “Atheism can not be True” and “Atheism can not be False”  
Therefore, Atheism can not be True.  (conjunctive elimination)

We now have two derived propositions:

1) Atheism is not propositional.  
2) Atheism can not be True.

Both of those propositions clearly can be true but if atheism is not propositional, then 2 can’t be true (and it can’t be false either).

So if an atheist says atheism is not a proposition, but merely a response to one then you can tell them if that is the case, then atheism can not be true. If they do not then see they have have to reject at least 1 or 2 they are in a state of irrationality with an inconsistent belief system, since for 2 to be true, 1 has to be true. If they accept 1, they must accept 2…if they accept 1 and reject 2 they have an inconsistent logical system as they end up with:

1) Atheism is not propositional.  
2) Atheism can be true.

Where clearly both of these premise can not be true. If 1 is True then 2 is False and **atheism can’t be true.** 

Then, soon as you tell the lack of belief atheist that using their system of premises atheism can’t be true, the triggering usually and inevitably ensues as is often the case of having irrational incoherent systems of belief."

I grew up in an evangelical household. I grew up watching TBN and listening to televangelists like John Hagee or Pat Robertson or David Jeremiah or the Crough family back in the day talking about how the Jews in Israel want to built a third temple. These televangelists would do fundraisings to try and help Israel rebuilt the temple. However the problem with these televangelists is that they have a secret agenda. They want to the temple to be rebuilt because according to the Bible (or at least in a dispensationalist interpretation) in the last days there will be a third temple in Jerusalem and the Antichrist will sit in the temple and desecrate it by claiming to be God, then stuff will hit the fan and Jesus will return.

These televangelists don't want the temple rebuilt because they care about the Jews. These televangelists want the the temple rebuilt because they want the world to end.

But setting evangelical delusions aside, Will a third Jewish temple ever be built in Jerusalem? Can it realistically happen?"

This is used by some Christians primarily to seperate themselves from others, as an evidence of their exclusive correctness, as a foundation for their pride and ego. So they say in their hearts; ""I am correct in my understanding, therefore I am holy"".

But Jesus has shown us the way, it is humility and compassion, loving others by listening to them and helping them. He has given us the truth, it is love and acceptance. He has shown us how to live, through service and self sacrifice. Jesus was the Word, the Logos, the reasoned discourse. He was a symbol of sacrificial suffering at the center of a cross. He was compassion made incarnate, or so the story goes.

The point of Christ was never that we could gain immortality and comfort in some heavenly abode and look down and mock those who didn't believe like us as they suffer, all because we were fortunate enough to be born into the right cultural religion. The material truth of the bible doesn't matter, it wasn't meant to. The point of Christ, the truth of Christ's example, is that the only path forward is together."

I've always been very agnostic, meaning I don't want to deny or confirm anything, because I don't feel like I'm in a place with the right to do so. 

My family is not religious in any way, someone is maybe a little bit spiritual but that's about it. Meaning, I can't really go to someone in my family for advice about this. I'm at a place in my life where religion is on my mind, frequently. I think it is because I long for the feeling of safety and happiness that religion seems to bring people all over the world, but also because I'm at an age where I'm curious about the ""real "" world, what that is to me and what my place here is. And I'm also just very curious about the concept of belief as a whole. It feels wrong to assume that the way I currently live my life is the only right way, just because I've always been told that it is. 

But I have so many questions. What religion is right for me? How do I know? Who do I talk to about this, that will actually be able to guide me? How do I reach out to communities that can help me? And how will I know that religion is the ""right answer"" for my thoughts, versus the wrong one?

When I was younger, I didn't want to hurt my mom's feelings (who dropped hints that she wanted me to be a Catholic) by telling her I wanted to be Jewish, and truthfully *I* didn't know what I wanted to be. Now I'm 14 (past the age of a Bar Mitzvah) and want to become more in touch with my Judaism. I don't know if I believe in G-d but I love Jewish traditions and want my children raised in a Jewish custom. What should I do? Can I convert to Judaism if I don't believe in G-d? Am I already Jewish? Can I still be Bar Mitzvahed? Please let me know in the comments as I am kind of having an identity crisis"

religion,lr18wq,Defining the line between Spirituality and Religion,"As everyone here knows, there's a lot of debate as to what a spirituality is vs a religion. Some people use the terms interchangeably, some apply arbitrary labels etc. 

I wanted to bring up this discussion because I think it's worth understanding how we come to these concepts. Firstly, many religious research institutions like [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/06/more-americans-now-say-theyre-spiritual-but-not-religious/) often have a category of ""spiritual, not religious.""

This has led me to the current, and IMHO reasonable, distinction I use:

Spirituality refers to personal beliefs which are often nebulous, open-ended, and not tied to organized beliefs. Personal individualist feelings, morals and often experience override established norms of religion. 

Religion refers organized sets of beliefs, traditions, and cultural aspects that are codified to some degree, usually contain an hierarchy (priests, laity, etc) and have more structure around them. 

A lot of people however seem to refer to spirituality for smaller or lesser known beliefs that do not conform to Abrahamic beliefs—I've seen Western Polytheism, neopaganism, Shinto, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism and indigenous beliefs called spirituality, often based on an arbitrary notion of them being less organized, which is usually not always the case.

So I want to at this point instead of starting a **debate** instead have a discussion. Maybe we can all sit down and have a conversation on where each of us draws the line. You get extra points from me if you have some kind of system for dealing with the distinction."

religion,lqzpjn,"Nihilism, depression and purpose.","Trying to keep things short here,so...: 

Context : I was raised in a non-religious household, with an atheist father and an agnostic mother.

I've always been somewhat skeptical of everything, more especially people and myself (even skeptical of my own day-to-day thoughts, dreams, goals, environment, fantasies, etc). 

I think I never thought too much about religion, other than what my father thought of it and of course all the bad things associated with religion through the news like terrorism. I think I naturally took the side of atheism, since most people here are also atheists.

So, somewhere along the line I became more cynical, and then increasingly so as I reached my early teen years. I questioned why everyone did the things they do - I remember being 10/11, and having one of those disco nights come up, and all I did was question the point of a disco night. I witnessed others getting excited over it and the boys and girls, of course being more tense, asking each other out to it. I would make remarks such as : 'this disco is childish, I can't believe people are taking it this seriously'. Im pretty sure it would even annoy me, even if slightly, why people would even bother caring about an event like this. But obviously I completely missed the point. 

Anyway, going off to a new school, I started to develop depression and social anxiety. I think, since I was already an atheist, and had depression, it helped me adopt a nihilistic philosophy, but I may have already been a nihilist - that there is no meaning to anything, no ultimate purpose. The depression and nihilism paired nicely, both complimenting each other. The nihilism trapped my thinking into breaking down everything into nothingness, and the depression meant I felt what I thought like (at least, I think, probably mostly) And also became Marxist without realising it, which also wasn't great for my outlook on life. 

I smoked weed and adopted a no care attitude to school and my own future. I then began to become interested in psychedelics, and then onto philosophy and other topics. This lead to my first experience of lsd, which didn't seem like a spiritual or mystical experience, even if it was one. And then 4 more times later. Not sure what happened along this time course but somewhere, something happened. What I think happened was : the LSD reset or opened my mind up - and I mean that figuratively and literally, or moved me onto the right path (I would only stay on that same path if I were wise enough, strong enough and good enough to), or maybe 'showed' me that path, or it could be said that I was shown Gods way, or that God showed me. Those toxic patterns of thoughts, those traps, were shown to me, and so can now never be forgotten. I am now agnostic, but leaning towards theism, not a nihilist, but still have tendencies towards negative thinking, depression,etc. So I have became more aware of my cynicism and thoughts disguised as rationale, I think.

But I still don't know what to do: what was bad thinking has now been revealed, but, still the truth hasn't been revealed, or maybe it has and something in me is blocking the revelation, or perhaps I am now not worthy or do not deserve, or would,by God's wisdom, not appreciate or not be able to accept the truth. I am beginning to suspect that I may never find answers to my questions, at least not by questioning. Which sounds stupid, but truth is a lot of the time revealed without even question of it; and answers are given in religious experiences.

I can write more but eh."
religion,lqzjb2,My BF says he might convert to Islam but I'm not sure whether if it's out of love or out of faith,"Me (21F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been dating in secret for almost 3 years because I come from a a Muslim family who don't allow dating. Throughout the time, I dealt with a lot of internal conflict and confusion about my values, my religion, etc. I tried breaking up due to my uncertainties and not wanting him to put his life on hold while I'm figuring out so much of my identity. He reassured me that he understood and he wanted to be there for me and that I don't have to figure things out alone.

In the first year of dating, at an attempt at helping me figure out how I feel about religion, it turned into a biased one sided conversation about helping me see how Islam isn't real. While I was struggling with my faith, seeing him bash the religion was still hurtful and he apologized and that was the end of that. In between that time he tried to learn more about Islam. He read the Quran, tried fasting a few days in Ramadan to support me, and tried to read and watch more videos about the religion as a whole. He was starting to become a lot more open minded to it but he definitely still had his struggles.

By, the 3rd year I came to terms with my identity and figured out that I wanted to have more of an Islamic lifestyle for my future. The uncertainty of our future crept up on me again and I told him that I think we should break up because I think that my view of how I want to raise my kids might clash with his since it might be more strict than what he's used to. However, he reassured me that he was completely fine with living an Islamic lifestyle and he even said he would be fine raising our kids as such. He would want them to have a proper Islamic education from Sunday school and he's completely fine with giving up alcohol considering he doesn't even really like to drink in the first place. I gave him various scenarios and hypotheticals to see his reaction and how he would deal with them and they aligned with mine. But something in me still felt uneasy.

Unfortunately, a few days ago my parents found out about our relationship. I talked to my bf about it and he was obviously worried about what would come of things. He was frustrated that they want to control my life and didn't want me to live a life of pleasing my parents . I told him about how even before the parents I've been having an internal battle about how well we would really work out and I explained that those who make it work are those who are only ""culturally Muslim"" and not religious. I brought up evidence from the big blow out in the 1st year and some other minor example that came after and told him how it makes no sense to raise your kid an Islamic way if you don't even truly believe it. He answered that he doesn't NOT believe in it and that he agrees with the values. I told him that only means that he might respect it but he doesn't believe in it 100%. If he really did he would already consider himself a Muslim by now. His reply was that just because he wasn't an actual Muslim it doesn't mean that he can't believe in it and that while he has not converted he would not be opposed to it. To me it felt like his words were very lukewarm. However, he kept telling me I was twisting his words and not trusting him. He kept saying that it would be foolish for him to lie about something so big or not go into it without thinking because it's only going to make both of us miserable in the future. I kept asking him more scenarios to see how he would react and his views aligned with Islam. I continuously emphasized how big of commitment this is and that there's no way to half-ass the religion and he told me that he completely understood he's been thinking about this for the past 2 years and he even asked 2 converts about the situation and their experience so he fully understands the difficulties that can come with it. Right now we're on a break so I can think things over and I'm at a crossroads: given everything I just mentioned- is this practical and will he truly be capable of handling this situation or is he just speaking purely out of love and wanting to stay together and this won't be a stable enough foundation for things to last. I can't read minds and I have the tendency to overthink things or read too deeply into it so maybe he really does mean what he say fully. I just don't want us to break up if there really is a chance and after how much he's dedicated himself to learning about this. But at the same time I don't want this conversion to feel forced or for him to throw away his whole identity and value system for a girl. "

I was born into a Muslim family however my mom never forced religion upon me she practices Islam but is not overly religious she has her issues with the religion but overall holds it close to her heart and still prays and wants to go to the grave as a Muslim. However when it comes to me since I was never taught anything I’m left here very confused. My mother told me growing up she was never allowed to question Islam which undoubtedly made her question Islam and she came to the conclusion that Judaism Christianity and Islam are all valid in there own way and she has respect for not just those 3 but every relegion out there as everyone has the right to believe what they want. That brings me to myself now I guess. I am very confused as I have no knowledge on any relegion I believe in god, heaven and hell etc but I’m just not sure which faith to follow some people tell me I’ll go to hell for being a Christian some say I’ll go to hell for being a Muslim when I was younger I used to tell people I was Christian just because I loved the way the religion was depicted on television and I was also a bit ashamed because when I was younger muslims were associated with terrorism and still are to an extent these days. As I grew older I accepted I was a muslim but never practiced any of the teachings the only Pillar I followed was fasting during Ramadan however my fasts were considered invalid since I didn’t pray (because I have no idea how to) All the muslims I associated with judged me due to my ignorance of the religion and pretty much told me I’m not even a Muslim so I shouldn’t be saying I am one and to an extent I guess they were right how can I say I’m a Muslim if I don’t follow the 5 pillars of Islam, so I decided to read the Quran but than I was told that I have to read the Arabic version because the English translation has alterations in it..... I’m genuinely very confused about what to do I have faith in god and I believe in religion to an extent but now I’m not to sure because it seems no matter what religion I follow in somebody’s eyes I’m going to hell. I’m sorry if any of this came off as offensive I truly am just an ignorant man looking for some sort of guidance, I figured posting here would be better since there would be no bias... if anybody has any words of advice or even criticism as to how I’m going about this situation it would be greatly appreciated, god bless you all."

He says that science does not have a stance on the supernatural in that it doesn't accept or deny the supernatural. He then says events that are scientifically unfounded such as the moon being split in half are supernatural occurences which science does not actively deny, which is why there is no contradiction; there is no scientific evidence for the occurrence of said event because it was supernatural and God chose not to leave any traces behind, and the event cannot be scientifically tested.

He says supernatural occurences and the existence of supernatural entities cannot be scientifically verified because it's beyond the perception of science, which is why it's impossible to provide scientific evidence because there is nothing scientific about them. 

To sum it up he's simply saying that God is a supernatural being and the supernatural cannot be scientifically proven, because it is not bound by the laws of science; something being not scientifically verifiable doesn't mean it does not exist and that you cannot scientifically prove something that is bound by science which doesn't make it absent.

religion,lqj6yw,Adam &amp; Eve Story as told by Wang Tai-yu (Chinese Gleams of Sufi Light),"&gt;At the time when the human ancestor's body was perfectly completed, his original real nature was still with the Real Lord. The two fountainheads that are life and wisdom wandered until they combined naturally in the body. After that, the four limbs and the one hundred bones, the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the tongue, all started to move with spiritual illumination.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Lord showed solicitude to the ancestor with caps and robes and He made him ascend the throne. He issued the mandate to the heavenly immortals to prostrate themselves before him all together, and He made them rise up and carry him around the heavenly sphere, and all of them obeyed the mandate. Then the Real Lord showed solicitude to the human ancestor by giving him great wisdom and real knowledge, so he penetrated thoroughly into the principle of heaven and earth and the nature of all ten thousand things. In this way, every name of each kind of thing was established. However, when the human ancestor remembered that the origin is pure and clean, and when he also considered that the body belongs originally to muddy dirt, he naturally became modest, and pride was not born in him.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the human ancestor was sleeping deeply, the Real Lord created his wife from his left rib and named her ""Hao-wa"" \[Arabic Hawwa\]. The reason for the intimacy of husband and wife is that originally they are of one body. Hence they should love and respect each other. The wife appeared from the husband, and the husband is the origin of the wife, so she should listen to his commands.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus you should know that the ancestor of human beings is one body, and this body was transformed into man and woman. From this we come to know the yin and the yang of the Great Ultimate, the life and the wisdom of the Non-Ultimate, the mercy and the severity of the Real Lord, the highest and the lowest, and the subtleness of the Original Beginning without end. Human beings are endowed with everything. If one fails to grasp this principle, one's whole life will be a drunken dream, and that would be a great pity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus the Real Lord gave the mandate to these two that they should live in the heavenly country forever and enjoy complete bliss everlastingly. However, a tree of wheat had grown up there, another name for which was ""the tree of causes and conditions."" The Lord forbade them to take from this tree. Unexpectedly, the leader of the devils and his followers came up stealthily to the heavenly country and seduced them to eat from the tree. At this time they just happened to become confused for a moment, and finally they were influenced by the devil's seduction and ""they disobeyed the contract"" with the Lord. Although this name is strong, in reality it was unavoidable that they would hit the target. At its root, this harmed them, but then it was turned into an advantage. Here there was a secret that could not be known by the devil. At this time the couple's caps and robes fell off and they became naked, so they covered their bodies with the leaves of the fig tree of the upper world. They did not look at each other, and they fell to the earthly world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Someone may say that human beings are the most spiritual and the most noble of all things. Why should they fall into trouble like this at the very beginning? I would reply that there are two reasons for this.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the time of the creation of human beings, the heavenly immortals and the various spirits did not know the reason for their creation. Because of this, the Real Lord issued a proclamation, saying, ""Truly I want to create human beings to represent Me in the world of existence."" The heavenly immortals protested and said, ""Their body is earth, water, fire, and air. These four contrary agents were gathered together and became the body. They will insult and violate each other. They will perhaps cause disorder in the future."" The chief spirit said, ""These human beings have desires, and seducing them is very easy,"" so all despised the human beings. Hence the Real Lord issued another proclamation and said, ""Indeed, I know affairs that you certainly do not now"" \[2:30\].  
&gt;  
&gt;The first reason for the descent of the human ancestors was that the heavenly country might become the place of ultimate happiness and complete bliss for good people. From ancient times to the present, tens of thousands of people have all been endowed with the one body of the human ancestor, and they combine with the two kinds - good and evil. If the ancestors had not descended and had not grown up here, good and evil would not become divided. Moving to this earthly world is to live among good and evil. After that, people follow their own kind. Good people go up, but evil people descend further.  
&gt;  
&gt;The second reason for the descent was so that the Real Lord could reject the protest of the heavenly immortals and shame the empty effort of the devils, because at root the Real Lord desired noble people. By making people suffer, He made them reach this situation. The human ancestors knew rightly the kindness and compassion of the Real Lord. At the beginning they woke up to their own disobedience and became more modest and humble.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ancestors became upset at the heavenly immortals' protest and they guarded themselves against the devils' deception. They obeyed the clear mandate and they conquered the selfishness of their selves. They entrusted their bodies and lives loyally to the Real Lord, and from the lowest they ascended again to the highest. Naturally, the protest of the immortals and the deception of the devil died down and dissipated. The Real Lord's mysterious contrivance was bright and uniquely brilliant. When we look at this, we see that although the name is ""falling into trouble,"" in reality this was an increase in completion.  
&gt;  
&gt;When you reflect and look at this situation, you will certainly come to know that the Non-Ultimate is the seed, the Great Ultimate is the tree, and the human ultimate is the fruit. The seed is the fruit, the tree is concealed in the fruit, and the fruit is concealed in the tree, which embraces comprehensively and penetrates thoroughly. Everything is complete. The Classic says, ""Those who are attached to the words and separated from the substance merely talk about the principle."" This is all because the selfishness of the self has not yet been purified and the eyes of the heart have not yet been opened.

According to the scriptures, the Vedas, Gita, the moment you become one with God, then everything is over, the Samsara comes to an end.

There is nothing beyond that which man can understand because we have not been given the comprehension to sense beyond the Divine, God, the power. Beyond that is not in our realm of human understanding. It is just like trying to ask the eyes to smell, the eyes cannot smell, the eyes can only see. A human being can only perceive up to God-realization and even the Gita or the Upanishads do not reveal anything beyond that because once we become one with the Divine, then there is nothing else.

religion,lqfgqi,"There is no God - This is the explaination. It's as short as I can make it, but it's naturally long. Debate.","**Part 1 - Religious History (abridged):**

**Stone age.** Original people decended from apes and were hunter gatherers. They live like Communists. Typically all hunter gatherers' first notion of religion was Animism. They do not have a linear sense of time passing, or a sense that the human race is special and headed to some ultimate conclusion. Thier idea is from their surroundings, that everything has a spirit and that you and your small tribe are equal to the animals and trees. They only know what they see, and this is what they see, this is what they know, and so this is how they build their beliefs.

**Classical antiquity.** Over time, these hunter gatherers walk down trails. Some pick up and eat some seeds. Some trails get used a lot. The seeds grow more plants. People notice this and set up permanent villages. Village life brings division of labour. Farmers to grow the grains and raise the sheep, soldiers to protect the grains, builders to build walls and granaries and of course, the ruling class. This new paradigm brings with it new concepts of religion. Man is not equal to animals, man is superior. Man can control the growth of crops. There are men that can control many other men and have great power. The gods begin to have hierarchy, effect crop growth, contol many other gods. This is what they see around them, this is what they know, so this is how they build their beliefs.

**Iron age.** There is more prosperity, more people, cities, further division of labour, life is more complicated, people are writing things down. The gods get more complicated, more diverse, have more indepth backstories, have huge families, the gods start to decree written laws. This is what they see, this is what they know, this is how they build their beliefs.

**Byzantine period.** Rulers have vast empires with diverse cultures that are hard to control. People have very different beliefs. People are unruly. The strong empires have singular leaders that rule with an iron fist and keep them together. The gods narrow. Maybe there's only one god. An all powerful god that rules over all. There can be only one. This is what they see, this is what they know, this is how they build their beliefs.

**You Cannot Have Monotheism Without Animism &amp; Polytheism First:**

Every religion can be seen as further revision of an older story back to the original / core Animism and the growth of religion is a monkey see, monkey do, mirror reflection of the society they live in. 

Imagine in your mind you are an Australian Aboriginal in the year 1,500AD. Your tribe is 50 people, you know how to create fire, make a didgeridoo, you know the forest and the animals very well and you have some stories about spirits in the sky, in the rocks, in the kangaroos etc. You have no heirarchy. No division of labour. No concept of ""war"". No understanding of farming or construction. There are no kings. You have almost no knowledge of the world beyond 50km in any direction. How are you suddenly going to come to the conclusion that Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem, was a carpenter and died on a cross for your sins. How would one conclude that Muhammed was a sheep herder is the prophet of Allah in Mecca? These stories require the society that creates them to have achieved certain social and technological landmarks. You must achieve agriculture to understand division of labour and that humans are in fact superior to animals / not one with nature (sad to some, but objectively true). With that division of labour and control over plants and animals, you can imagine there might be spirits that also have such representitive purposes. Vesta the God of the home and hearth cannot be created in a pre-agricultural society. Just as a Monotheism also needs to develop from a Polytheism. One must have many city states established before empires can arise. Upon the advent of empires, a king of kings can occur and with it the concept of Monotheism. 

**The First Monotheism - Overview of Zoroastrianism Beliefs (circa 1,000 - 1,500BC):** Ahura Mazada is all that is good and created a perfect world. He has 6 (or 7) archangels that work for him and do various tasks. Angra Mainyu is a force of darkness and fights against the light of Angra Mainyu. He has inserted demonic influence into the world and wishes to trick people. He doesn't want you to know he exists and wants to twist people from the shadows. If you follow Angra Mainyu, you will go to Hell. Hell is a place of molten metal that people must walk around in continuously. At the end of time will come an epic battle of good vs evil and a judgement day. During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken and humankind will turn on religion and say Ahura Mazda doesn't exist. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu will terrorize the world. The righteous will be saved by the son of Zarathustra, named Saoshyant. Towards the end of days, he will be born of a virgin. Saoshyant will represent Ahura Mazada on Earth and wage war against Angra Mainyu and plunge Angra Mainyu into Hell and he will bring about the resurrection and eternal life to Ahura Mazda's loyal followers. They will live in a paradise on Earth. This monotheist religion predates Islam by 1,500 to 2,000 years, Christianity by approximately 1,000 to 1,500 years and predates Judaism by a few hundred years.

Zoroastiranism is basically the main root of Abrahamic religions. It's not entirely Zoroastrianism nor entirely linear of course, much of these religions also sample from polytheisms of the time such as Canaanite polytheism, Egyptian and Indo-Iranian polytheism, and they were also influenced by many short-lived transitional religions such as Mithraism and the many other Mysteries. Suffice it to say, it's a story that has gone through many, many iterations and rewrites for thousands of years, filtered through many different cultures, translated through different languages etc., and that makes it interesting, and of deep cultural value for humanity, but it doesn't make it any more true than the Ilyad or the Epic of Gilgamesh.

**Our Monotheisms Are Complicated, Because They're About Us:**

In our religious texts, God's motivations are not clear and are contradictory because God's motivations are actually our motivations and they change over the centuries. Basically though, we want people to be good to each other, we want justice, we want to live forever, we want praise, and for people to love and accept us. On the flip side, we also want to punish people that murder and don't conform to societal norms, that don't do as we think is right, therefore our God / God's want those same things. We cannot concieve of what the motivations of an all powerful alien being would be, so of course our God / God's are a mirror reflection of we want / of us, and what we want / are is complicated, conflicting and often cruel. But it tends to explain our religious texts much better than an all powerful being that is jealous of his own creations.

**End:** The above should detail that there is no God and that there is a perfectly reasonable explaination for today's major modern religions that does not require a God.

I want so badly to make a change

But in this world I feel so helpless

In this world I feel so strange

And out of place among these people

Who can’t see past the lie

To embrace a true reality

No man up in the sky. 

————————————————————————

They think they’ll live eternal

They think they’ll live forever

Up in heaven with their god

But it’s a lie that we must sever

And reject the childish nonsense

And throw out the childish games

This life’s the only one we get

and time forgets our names. 

————————————————————————

They say that man was made from mud

And woman from a rib

They say a snake fucked it up

With just a little fib

But it was the snake that told the truth

And the god who told the lie

For he said “the day you eat

Is the day you surely die.”

————————————————————————

Why do people believe these stories

Why do they believe the tales

Written by ignorant Bronze Age men

Who couldn’t tell fish from whales

There never was a Noah

Who lived throughout a flood

And Jesus wasn’t the son of god

There’s no power in the blood. 

————————————————————————

We need to end our reliance 

On myths, and legends, and fables

We need to learn all that we can 

To eventually turn the tables

On all the religions of the world 

And take our rightful place 

At the front of the running pack 

To be the winner of the race. 

————————————————————————

Because if we allow things to carry on 

The way they’ve always been 

Civilization will die and we will fall

Humanity cannot win 

All we’ve built will come crumbling down 

In a wave of nuclear fire 

Brought on by extremists of a religious bent 

Civilization goes no higher. 

————————————————————————

Unless we learn from past mistakes 

Unless we do much better 

We’re doomed to keep fucking up

And fucking up forever

Though, I don’t have much hope for us
 
And think we’re ending our run 

Unless we change, and do it soon 

This experiment is done. 

————————————————————————

We need to grow, and do it fast 

Before they rule us all 

Because if they gain the power 

They’ll hold us all in thrall

They’ll rule with the iron fists of gods

And dictate what we think 

They’ll slaughter any and all who resist 

And you’ll miss it if you blink. 

————————————————————————

So consider examining what you believe
 
To see if it is true 

And if there is no evidence 

Simply change your world view

To something that better matches reality 

And is based on cold hard facts 

Not Bronze Age mythology 

And religious artifacts. 

————————————————————————

The world would be much better off

If it relied on reason and science

And threw out faith and superstition

And other pseudoscience

But we are weak and trapped in comfort 

Provided by religion

And, as it is, that’s your right

But I’d rather be in prison."

religion,lp9k46,Bible Review 4 The Book of Numbers: Israel is Us.,"\-Recently, I had the grand idea to finally read through one of the most polar and historical books known to mankind, and sheepishly, to post my thoughts publically and see the inputs I got. So far, I have been blessed by the readings and supremely impressed by all the feedback I have received. So, thank you.

\- It was a dark morning out on the lake today, with the surface of the choppy waters a reflective obsidian. As I have said in the past, I have made the combination of fishing and reading together a thing. I had began The Book of Numbers, the fourth of the books of Moses, with the understanding it was going to be an extention of Leviticus. I was surprised to find it was not. Weird and wild events occur here, and in many of them I am not altogether sure what truly happened. I found Numbers to be a a book of struggles, a book of frustrations, between both God and His people. It is a sad book. It also has a lot to say about life, especially life under the Lord. I reached an odd stage of melancholy several times reading these passages, and I think I can tell why.

\- Israel is real (ha), because Israel...is us. Let me explain. When first introduced to recently delivered Israel, we find out pretty quickly that this is a whiny, stubborn people who boldly rebel against a God who has just...annhilated one of the mightiest kingdoms in Egypt. And as a ""high-minded"" reader, I scoff at the molten calf, the murmurings, the strange fire offerings, the complaining, the pettiness, the cowardice, the lustfulness of other gods or idols. Nabab and Abihu. Korah and his family. Even Aaron and sister Miriam get caught up in rebelling against Moses, and a God who has shown in an instant that He will punish. And, as a reader I am left to say ""Why?! Did you not see what God did to the Egyptians? Or how He consumed Aaron's sons? Or how He swallowed Korah with the Earth?! What are you doing? Stop it!"" But, here is the thing. We would all do the same, because we are the same. Humans are a forgetful animal. It's like wondering how Borat is able to still dupe prominent officials. Over time, we forget, we fall back in our ways, and we only are aware of ourselves and what is done right by us. And, that makes me incredibly...depressed... as I think of how often I have done the same.

\- Sitting out alone on a dark lake, watching a still line, no bites and painful thoughts. Why did I not take this path in life? Or, why did I run into this person who has caused me so much grief? Why has God made some people so lucky, so rich, so handsome? And, yet me so unfortunate? It is about us, right? It takes real effort to blink those thoughts away and realize you aren't alone, both on the lake and in life. Cormorants sit on a nearby buoy as the breeze ruffle their dark, waterproof feathers. A pair of bald eagles circle the west end of the lake, possibly signalling a school of fish below. A small turtle rises to the surface for a quick gasp of air before dipping back below. Living outside one's self is hard. It is difficult. Life, with all its comforts of being a human, and for me an American, is still tough, because day to day for most of us is a physical and emotional battle. We are rarely satisfied, and me- often finding peace in the moment can be difficult to attain. I can relate to Israel, even with them daily witnessing the presence of God, being a stubborn and lustful people. Because I am one. Israel and God have a trainwreck of a relationship sometimes, and I think I can say the same for myself too. Being alive is a gift, but it is also hard. Just ask Moses who leads these rebellious people, has one single moment of frustration, and is prevented from entering the Promised Land.

\- If anyone wants to chime in on Numbers, I have some topics I am not so clear on. What the heck happened with Balaam of Beor? Is he a good guy or bad? Why was he slain? He seemed to know God. Why was God so hard on Moses, a man He looked at as a friend? Is it me or did the stoning of the man who collected sticks on the Sabbath seem incredibly cruel? Didn't Jesus also work on the Sabbath? Life in ancient times was rough. Also, the numbers of Israel seem truly...exaggerated right? Babylon and Assyria were some of the premier empires in these ages, and yet I do not believe they crossed the million inhabitant mark (did they?). Israel easily does, despite whole swathes of them being wiped out by plagues and punishments.

\-My line bobs hard and I pull to set the hook. I feel the barb sink briskly into the meat of a fish, and the struggle for catch and freedom begins. I reel and reel, my heart leaping as I observe the sleek body of a chain pickerel breeching the lake's surface. Fight and struggle. My 4 lb line sings with tension. As the spotted body of the fish rolls towards shore, I wade into the water to snatch my prize. Then, SNAP! my unfaithful hook pops out and the fish is liberated before I can claim it. For a moment, my fish stares at me, exhausted, suspended in the shallows and in disbelief. I, myself, oddly am satisfied. The struggle for life and meaning does not pertain only to me after all, and in Numbers I found more than merely another book of law and rites, but maybe also a book of comfort and reflection. Israel struggled with God holding their hand. I have made it this far on faith and determination. I will press on. We will survive, and things will be alright. My fish and I both turn away from one another and retreat back to our respective ecosystems, him to the depths and me towards the shore."
religion,lp99os,Just wanna share why i believe.,"Guess it's a vent because I've barely told anyone and when people ask me if I'm religious i either say 'sure', 'nah' or 'it's a long story'

A few years ago i was suicidal. Not because of a chemical imbalance in the brain or anything, just circumstance. I just had literal psychopaths as parents and they'd physically torture me, lock me inside a room like a prison, yell at me, beat me etc etc etc. One day i ran away.

Had barely any possessions and barely any money. I was in a country i didn't speak the language of amd finding any job was difficult.

I was homeless and struggling with PTSD for a long time.

So i was suicidal. Because who wants to live like this.

I knew that most suicides are impulse-driven and most survivors regret the attempt ad not repeat it. So i decided to make sure it wasn't an impulse. I marked every day i **didn't** wish to die for 3 months straight. The day count was 0.

So i was like okay I'm doing this I'll kill myself.

I've always been an agnostic. I didn't care if god exists and if he/she/they did i didn't think its something important. But i had an idea. I'll die in a week anyway. So I'll just go to an orthodox church, a catholic church, a protestant church, a mosque, a synagogue and i also found a buddhist temple so i went to one too. I sat in each for 5 minutes and asked for a miracle.

And two days later i got a call from a landlord. I can move in from the first of next month. I will not be homeless anymore. Same day, i had a friend who i hadn't talked to in ages randomly write to me ask me how I'm doing. Another day later i got a job interview and they said I'm hired. It was my first full time job, because as a racial minority not speaking the native language that shit is incredibly hard. Later that week i got asked if i wanna join a cooking club by a different friend who i hadn't talked to in ages (i cook as a hobby i really enjoy it) 

I spent 7 months homeless working the worst jobs, getting paid just enough to get food and not die. I worked hard the entire time to escape this. With no effects. None at all.

I go and pray for a miracle and all of this happens WITHIN A WEEK?

I can't explain it. It makes no sense. It's a literal miracle. 

So I've concluded that there's a god. Or gods. Or some higher power.

I don't think i believe in any religion out there but i believe that there's a god.

So from time to time i go to the church right next to me and i light a candle and sit in silence for a bit. I'm not Christian it's just the closest religious building.

Anyways i just wanted to get this off my chest."

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Way of Friendship (yu-tao). What you enjoy, give to your friend, and what you do not want, keep for yourself. The Heavenly Classic is your first ancestor, and true people are all your brothers. The Bonds and Constants of the True Teaching are the Tao of brothers, friends, families, and neighbors.

.

&gt;The Observation of Time (ch'a-shih). The human body has the subtlety of seeing, hearing, listening, and speaking, all of which are controlled by the principle of the true heart. If the heart principle is not clear, one cannot govern the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and the hundred bones. There are many mistakes in what is seen with the eyes, but there will be no fault in what is observed by the principle. To cultivate the heart principle one must increase virtues such as real knowledge, humility, frugality, modesty, patience, faithfulness, and nobility. In sum, one needs to conquer oneself, because although the form is the same in having self and not having self, the gap is that between good and evil.

.

&gt;Reflecting and Awakening (ts'an-wu). The Classic says, ""Why do you not reflect upon what is in yourself?"" (Koran 6:50). The Sage said, ""You can reflect upon the internal or external solicitude and mercy of the Real Lord, but you cannot reflect upon the root nature of the Real Lord."" Mercy has three sorts: external, internal, and real. The external mercy is heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things, which are for the use of humans. The internal mercy is body, life, and the power to pursue the principles of affairs. The real mercy is the teachings and rulings of the true Tao, which guide the deluded on the path. Only when you follow the true Tao and cause the human level to advance will you not betray the three mercies.

.

&gt;The Afterworld (hou-shih). Human beings experience three worlds: the original beginning, which is the time of the seed; the present, which is the time of the sprouting; and the return, which is the perfecting of the fruit. The Classic says, ""This world is the field of the afterworld."" Those who cultivate flowers reap flowers, and those who plant thorns reap thorns.

I just started a podcast to work on trying to struggle my way through some harder conversations, talking to friends and professionals who have different viewpoints than me. I feel like the tribalism and groupthink dynamics that social media is teaching us is killing the art of the conversation, so I wanted to work on getting better and speaking and listening for long periods of time--long enough periods of time that I could begin to genuinely get to know people and perspectives that I don't understand. That's the project of ""This Could Be Interesting"".

religion,loj7u2,"I went to bed to my girlfriend who just had fallen asleep a couple of minutes earlier and right after laying down I saw this glowing green orb exiting her body, coming in front of me as if it was looking at me and then reversing outside my bedroom window.","

I'm 100% sure it was her Spirit.(light body or whatever you wanna call it.)

I've read that we aren't aware of 90% of what is going on around us. (In terms of energy, electromagnetic fields, vibrations, spirits, angels, brainwaves, wavelengths, frequencies and ect.)

Personally I believe in this especially because I've experienced a lot of events that many would consider ""weird, hallucinations, paranormal and spiritual"".

One time I was Meditating ""Buddha style"" with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me.

Nowadays while thinking or talking to someone  I get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while. All varying in different colours. Nowadays I mostly see blue.

All of this has been happening to me since 2013 when I've started Meditating and getting really into spirituality. 

If you are interested I've made this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/Wl1hPZUFM3g) about which method of Meditation opened my awareness to be able to witness these sightings. Let me know your thoughts on it!"

For my very brief overview and more quotes, check out my post yesterday: [https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/lnjefw/quotes\_from\_wang\_taiy%C3%BC\_chinese\_gleams\_of\_sufi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/lnjefw/quotes_from_wang_taiy%C3%BC_chinese_gleams_of_sufi/)

We haven't even gotten into the main text ""*The Great Learning of the Pure and Real"",* so all these passages so far are from ""*The Real Commentary on the True Teachings"".*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Resemblance to the Real (ssu-chen). In order to attain resemblance to the Real, one needs to observe the clear mandate and recognize the Real Lord, who transforms and produces everything. To do this one needs to know the relationship between the Real Lord and the universe. If you cannot recognize yourself, you cannot investigate things. If you cannot investigate things, you cannot exhaustively search for the principle. If you cannot exhaustively search for the principle, you cannot purify your nature and clarify your heart. Hence you cannot discern your origin. If you cannot discern your origin, you cannot know the Utmost Sage. How then will it be possible to serve the Real Lord?

.

&gt;Life and Death (sheng-ssu). Life and death need to be defined in terms of being and nonbeing. There are three degrees of being - being without beginning or end, being with beginning and without end, and being with both beginning and end. Death should be understood in relation to three degrees of nature: living, aware, and spiritual. The death of the human body does not mean the death of the human spirit.

From my understanding of this Sufi concept which also occurs in the Baha'i Faith (see: The Seven Valleys) - it is like this: being without beginning or end (God, the ""Real One""), being with beginning and without end (""The Numerical One"", Creation/Spirit), and being with both beginning and end (physical material forms, ""The 10,000 Things""). Here is the following passage:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Human Level (jen-p'in). The mysterious pivot of the Human Ultimate encompasses the ten thousand images. It is one, but it is then transformed into two, which are husband and wife. ""One"" is the human, and ""two"" is humanity (jen). Thus, the Three Bonds and Five Constants are established on the humanity of husband and wife. Only the human being - not heaven or earth - was able to manifest the great ability of the Real Lord.

*- The Real Commentary on the True Teachings*

The five constant virtues of Confucianism are: benevolence or *ren* (仁), righteousness or *yi* (义), propriety or *li* (理), wisdom or *zhi* (智) and fidelity or *xin* (信). Later however Wang Tai-yu uses this term ""The Five Constants"" to refer to the Five Pillars of Islam. But from what I can tell, here he is referring to it in the Confucian context.

The three bonds on Confucianism are the following relationships: ""ruler / ruled"" (for Wang Tai-yu this refers to God \[The Real Lord\] and Creation), ""father to son"", and ""husband to wife"".

.

&gt;The True Learning (cheng-hsueh). The Sage said, ""Both the male and the female of the True Teaching have the clear mandate to learn and practice."" Learning is not useless learning, it must be learning along with deeds. Learning without deeds is like a flower without fruit. Deeds without learning are like a house without a gate. The true learning has three kinds: the great learning, which is returning to the Real; the middle learning, which is clarifying the heart; and the constant learning, which is cultivating the self.

.

&gt;Bearing Witness (tso-cheng). To recognize the Lord, you first must say, ""I bear witness."" This is because, in order to recognize the Lord, you must first recognize yourself. Bearing witness (i.e., the Shahadah) is the call to awakening from the drunken dream of the ancients and the moderns.

.

&gt;The Five Constants (wu-ch'ang). The Five Constants (i.e., Islam's Five Pillars) are remembrance (Shahadah), giving (alms tax, zakat), worship (daily prayer, salat), abstention (fasting during Ramadan), and gathering (pilgrimage, the hajj)."
religion,lo9z0o,Question about the afterlife and spirits,"This was inspired by [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/lo9dwo/recently_deceased_father_keeps_trying_to_tell_me/) which I felt wasn't quite the right place to make my comment in.

I know some religious people think their deceased family members and friends can visit them or relay messages to them in some way. But is that backed up by the bible/Quran, that after you go to heaven you can return to earth and influence people there? Or that, due to reasons unknown, they can somehow stay behind on earth as spirits/ghosts?

I know some Christian priests believe that demons prowl ""the spiritual realm"", and they recommend that you never try to contact anyone there. But I'm not sure what they think about human spirits. And regardless of their personal beliefs, is it backed up by scripture?"

If God's son was Jewish, isn't that a sign that they got it right? I mean if Jesus knew he was God's son and was still Jewish, wouldn't that add serious weight to the validity of Judaism? If Jesus was Jewish, why would he preach a new doctrine? Why not try to spread his preferred religion, Judaism? Basically how/why did a devout Jewish man start a new religion?"
religion,lo9dwo,Recently Deceased Father Keeps Trying to Tell Me Something In Dreams - Catholic,"Okay this is going to be a very strange post, admittedly.

To start, my father was raised Catholic but never really practiced God in particular. He believed in a higher power and that when he died he’d meet his maker, regardless of what God they were and what intentions they had with him. Well, a few months ago, he met his maker and very suddenly passed away young.

I’m his only daughter and subsequent best friend. He never raised me nor my younger brother Catholic. We were baptized, and then never set foot in a church again, except for my mother’s mass. We talked a lot about religion, about how I felt in reincarnation or the afterlife and who he felt God was and if he would see an afterlife or Hell. (My father thought himself a bad person, while I don’t necessarily agree, I’m not one to make those judgements).

Since his sudden death, I’ve had dreams of him coming back to life. Dreams where I know he is dead and then, for whatever reason, he’s back. These actually creeped me out for a time, because the first time it happened it felt so real I had to call the hospital again to make sure. 

Then, just now, I woke from a dream where I was book-shopping. After walking around and buying products, I thought I should really call my dad to come pick me up. Then it dawned on me that he is dead and couldn’t possibly do that. I still looked at my phone anyway and saw I had an unread voicemail on it so I listened to it. It was from my dad, who said I had to read Corinthians 2-7-7 (or 27-7, or something along lines of 2 then 7 then 7) because an author has proclaimed something about how it spoke to them and my father believed it spoke to him, too.

I rushed to find a bible in the bookstore but woke up when I found one. 

However, Corinthians 2-7-7, 27-7, etc. doesn’t exist. And I don’t know what he wants me to think, if it’s even him trying to tell me something in the first place. I don’t own a bible. Neither did he. It’s all really freaky that I keep having these types of dreams where I feel either my father is still alive or is trying to say something. It’s an eerie feeling, truthfully. 

Does anyone - of any faith - have suggestions?"

But the difference of cult beliefs in comparison to religion are there's always a leader who is in human form and can vocally speak to their followers. 

I believe in self awareness and higher self so no way in hell am I in any beleif of a single God apart from thy self (yeah no I really do hate religion)

If God were a legit speaking breathing eating shitting human who could voice his shit then yes Armageddon would've been over and done with by now going on the rules by the bible (again I don't know shit).

Now look at every cult in all of history of mankind. There was always a leader. A manipulative brainwashing asshole preaching bullshit saying they're the chosen one to speak for whatever God. Or they can take you to the height of your superior being by taking their orders with contributing a fucn load of money.

Yes religions do this, some worse then others. But there's never a single communicator as far as I know.

So also, the possessions we have seem to be ours, but eventually in the end, nothing belongs to us, we come empty-handed and we go empty-handed. Therefore what is the one eternal thing? It is the Divine Soul that we are, the realization of the Divine within us - that is the only eternal happiness. When we realize God within, then we reach that state of Sat Chit Ananda, a state of eternal joy and everlasting peace."

religion,lnva18,Who here used to watch Jack Van Impe Presents on the Trinity Broadcasting Network?,"I did. I used to be a fan of Jack Van Impe Ministries back when I was younger and more religious. I still remember his show used to come out on wednesdays at 8:30 pm. Where I live a local religious channel call Daystar also aired his show on fridays at 9:pm. On his show he and his wife Rexella would read weekly headlines and he would interpret them as signs of the end times.

Despiite his absurdity I used to love listening to him. There's was something cozy about listening to an elderly couple at warning of an impending apocalypse. My favorite parts of the show were the brief moments with Chuck Ohman. He had a voice that would make Morgan Freeman blush.

Of course on the Trinity Broadcasting Network there's all these famous end time dispensationalist televangelists like John Hagee, Pat Robertson and David Jeremiah among others. But jack Van Impe was my absolute favorite.

He died on january of 2020. Which was surprising because If every he taught on his show and video tapes was trustworthy then he shouldn't have ever died and there shoudn't have been a 2020."

(2) How is the conclusion by default ""it has to mean my religion is right"" when there's other possible explanations, e.g. that maybe everyone could be getting experiences from the same source *in spite of* their different religions? ... in the same way that ALL religious communities \[Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, pagans, etc\] are getting provision (food, etc) from God *in spite of* their beliefs.

religion,lnrk5j,Bible Review 3: Unpopular Opinions in Leviticus,"\- On a continuously snowy day here in upstate New York, I decided to keep pushing through the Old Testament and treat myself to The Book of Leviticus. I had been warned Leviticus was kind of a slog, and brothers and sisters, you were right. However, I did gleam a few worthwhile observations to put together a little report to give me closure on the third Book of Moses.

\-To begin, I think it is really important to discern who Leviticus is intended for, and who the Lord is giving Law to. Throughout the book, the Lord repeats certain phrases, one of them being the theme of how He is holy, and therefore He is attempting to make his people holy. The intention of this book is to seperate Israel from the other tribes in the land. So many of us silly gentiles miss that. So, when we see some strict, weird ass laws, they weren't necessarily meant for us. These are the methods the Lord wanted to go about using to distinguish His people from the surrounding tribes. They are meant to be a testament of what the people of the Lord look like and behave like. So, go ahead and round your beards, gentiles, it's ok.

\- On a serious note, unpopular opinion. I wanted to just quickly tackle the law against being gay. Right off, I do not believe being gay is wrong or evil, nor care if two men or two women want to be married or together. So calibrate your tastes to my opinion and decide whether what I have to say is worth reading or not. For the life of me, I have never understood our obsession with attacking and persecuting those who are different from us. I have heard so many use the Bible as a weapon against those of different sexual orientation. In Leviticus, the Lord spends all of two verses on condemning this, while spending many more on other sins and behaviors the ""regular"" man and woman are guilty of daily. I don't get some folks obsession with this. In the end, even IF being gay is considered a sin in the eyes of the Lord, who was it Jesus preferred to dine with and commune with? I think we need to examine our own shortcomings and leave off judging others.

\-I won't pretend to have memorized or understood a lot of the different feasts and offerings mentioned here. I will note however, the importance of innocent blood atoning for sin, and the dedication to uphold the statutes of the Lord with a willing heart. I do believe that's the main desire of God here with His people. And think about it, seeing the carnage of precious animals from your flock being slaughtered is rather horrifying and would both cause you not to err as much, as well as you would only do these things based on true belief. First borns, unblemished, blood atonement...the pointings toward the New Testament Christ is already obvious.

\-I want to focus on some of the beauty in the Law too. God's commandments have sympathy for the poor and the foreigner. Farmers were to leave the corners of their fields of the poor among them. Strangers, though meant to be differentiated from, were also meant to be treated with hospitality. And remember! Even though some of these laws and statutes may seem particularly brutal to us today, these were given in a time when Babylonians, or Assyrian kingdoms existed, and buddy, those tribes were the epitome of awful to their subjects. The Hebrew nation is downright passive and hospitable compared to them.

\-Poor Aaron. Guy watches two of his sons consumed by the Lord, and has to keep right on trucking. I didn't think much of him allowing Israel to molt the golden calf, and make themselves fools. I feel a lot more for him in this chapter. His angst in losing his sons can be felt here, and as the head priest he has to keep up the standard with a grieving heart.

\-Leviticus gets a bad rep, but think of it as God going to extra lengths to build something that will draw other nations to Him. He is a jealous God after all. It is written in a time quite foreign to us, and in an age where these commandments made a lot more sense to the people. Leprosy was more pervasive, as was rape, incest, animal cruelty, cannabalism, tribal warfare, slavery and so on. As ""civilized"" folk, this book seems odd and quaint, but don't think it wasn't necessary. Aspects of our culture will one day seem strange to future societies, I am sure of it.

\-And, for God's sake, don't you dare pass your seed through fire unto Molech."
religion,lnosdi,I have a query on the topic of Adam and Eve,"I don't follow any religion. I'm agnostic. I love science, but I am also very interested in what religious folk have to say. I'm genuinely curious and I don't mean to poke fun or attempt to debunk your beliefs. I have no problems with people believing in god :) I'm not here to judge anyone. 

Questions:

(1) Is the story of Adam and Eve taken literally or as a metaphor of sorts?

(2) If literally, how did we end up with multiple ethic groups? How do we have Asian, Black, Latin, Caucasian, Indian, Middle Eastern ethnic groups if we all originate from 2 people? Did some of their children magically change appearance as the family tree expanded? Our appearances can differ greatly.

(3) If everybody's ancestors are Adam and Eve, doesn't that mean we are all incest? Children born from incest generally have abnormal bodies and mental deficiencies. This should be the case for everyone if we all originate from Adam and Eve, right? 

(4) Where did Adam and Eve go and what did they do after being kicked out of the garden?

religion,lnoax6,Friendship Religious Differences,"So here’s the story. I’m a Catholic since birth and no plan in changing my religion. My whole family is Catholic. Then I have a Christian friend who simply has different ways of praying than me, leads a bible group study and a church mass. I’m religious but not super religious as her. We go to different churches pre-pandemic (I go to a Catholic church and she goes to Jesus Is Lord church).

She invited me to their church and join their bible study a few times already but I would always decline politely. And when I decline, I always explain to her that I have a different way of praying and to just respect my own choices and beliefs. 

I told her that I respect her own beliefs and choices and it’s her life so I have nothing against that, but my problem is the way she keeps on insisting and trying to dictate how to live my life is the most annoying thing.

Then almost two weeks ago, we had an argument because she just wouldn’t stop. She told me I don’t have a relationship with the Lord because I do not read the bible and kept making me feel like the way I’m praying is wrong and that I’m not a good person. I guess I just really lost my patience because she just wouldn’t stop bringing up and shoving her religious beliefs to me.

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year and what my friend did to me didn’t really help at all.

For me, religion is a sensitive topic and the fact that my bestfriend kept questioning my faith and my life choices really got into my nerve. I felt disrespected and offended by her and honestly I don’t know if I could still continue being friends with her.

Any friendly advice on religious differences situations like this?"

Wang Tai-yu (Wang Daiyu) was a Muslim scholar who lived in China in the 16th-17th centuries. Fluent in Persian, Arabic, and Chinese, he studied the writings of Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, and philosophical Sufi Islam. He was the first author to write about Islam in Chinese language, and even using Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist contexts, in order to explain Islam to Chinese, and to explore the similarities and differences between these philosophies through a dual native Chinese/Islamic lens.

&gt;  
&gt;The guest said, ""If something does not exist here, certainly its dwelling is outside heaven \[and earth\]. How can it not be in a place?  
&gt;  
&gt;He answered, ""When yang is in harmony and moves with one movement and the ten thousand things flourish, do you say that spring is inside the things, or outside the things? Inside and outside can be argued only for you and me. How can you argue them for the Real Lord? Tell me, then - before there were heaven and earth, how many things are here and how many outside heaven?""

\- The True Answers

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1. The Real One (chen-i). There are two levels of oneness: the Only-One, which is the Real Lord; and the Numerical One (shu-i), which is the origin of the universe. It is the latter that is referred to by such well-known sayings as ""The Great Ultimate produces the two wings, and the two wings produce the four images"" (I Ching); ""The ten thousand dharmas return to One"" (Buddhism); and ""The Nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth, and the Named is the mother of the ten thousand things"" (Tao Te Ching 1). The Real One is the Unique One, not the Numerical One.

\- The Real Commentary on the True Teaching

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. Predetermination (ch'ien-ting). Freedom and predetermination are correlative realities of human existence. Establishing good and evil is predetermination, and make use of good and evil is freedom. Were there no predetermination, there would be no freedom, and without freedom predetermination would not be manifest. Were there no differences, perfection would not become manifest, and were there no crookedness, the ultimate justice would not become clear.

religion,lnfg3m,How do you make peace with a religion when you’re unsure about everything?,"I asked about religious truth a bit back but honestly I think my bigger problem is peace with a path. Especially in an Abrahamic faith, atheism, and agnosticism. I’m not sure what I believe, and that’s partially because I can’t make peace with any decision.

I can’t honestly call myself a Muslim anymore, because I haven’t made peace with that path. I cannot be an atheist because I’m not certain there is nothing there. You might say atheism doesn’t require certainty, but it does for me because to say “there is nothing out there” is a pretty big statement, to me equal to “there is one God and He revealed Islam.”

As a Muslim I couldn’t make peace with the idea that Islam was definitely true. As a pagan (for a few months) I couldn’t make peace with the idea that there were definitely many gods and that Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are false. As I guess an agnostic now, I can’t make peace with not knowing. This uncertainty extends to so many parts of my life: I’m unsure my parents are truly my biological parents—what if they aren’t? I’m unsure if all historical figures existed—what if they were made up and we just assumed they were real? I’m unsure if the moon landing happened—what if it was faked? I’m pretty sure all of these things are true, but what if they aren’t?

So, how do I be at peace with a path?"

religion,lmyt00,Forsaking All,"When Jesus walked by the shores of Galilee, he called some fishermen who had just caught the biggest haul of their lives: ""Come follow me and I will make you fishers of men!"" Immediately they forsook all and followed him! (Luke 5:2-11) They forsook the fish, the nets, their boat, their livelihood, their old life, and even their poor old father!

How could they do such a thing? How could they forsake their living, and their own family and friends, without even giving notice, to follow this strange Stranger and his motley crew? They did it because he offered them a better life, a better job, with a better Boss, for a better family, and with better rewards! Why ""labour for the food that perishes"" (John 6:27) when you can win immortal souls, who will be your friends forever!

Someone said, ""First let me say farewell to my father."" Jesus replied, ""He that puts his hand to the plough and then looks back is not worthy of me!"" (Luke 9:61-62) ""But let me at least bury my father,"" said another. (The father probably wasn't even dead yet, and this might have taken months or years!) Jesus firmly said, ""Let the dead bury the dead! You come and follow me!"" (Luke 9:59-60)

God refuses to take second place to anything or anyone. He will not let you put any other god before him - not your old job or your old boss or even your old family and friends! God is your Boss now and he has a new job for you that will not wait. This is God's first test for every would-be disciple. To see if you love him enough to put him first by forsaking all immediately to follow him!

""Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you!"" (Matthew 6:33)

God will not tolerate you putting anything else before him and his work. If you can bring the boss and family with you, fine. But obviously the disciples' father was unwilling to leave his boat business and all those nice fish and follow Jesus with them--and we never hear of him again. The father who stuck by the business vanished into oblivion, while his sons wandered off with a perfect Stranger and made history, helping millions of souls for eternity.

Isn't it ridiculous now to compare the business, the father, and the family, which all soon perished, with the millions of immortal souls who have been saved through the decision of those fishermen to put God first that day, drop everything, and follow Jesus! Now that we can see the results, it's easy to know they made the right choice despite their father's objections and the wrecking of his business.

Nothing is more important than God and his work of love to save the world. God's only time is now! The guys who stalled never came back. And their list is longer than the list of followers. Many are called, but few have chosen to follow him above all. Who and what are you going to put first?

Why not ask the boss and family to come along? They could follow just as well, you know.

If they're not willing, they don't deserve you! Which is more important: Serving them or saving the world? The time is Now! Tomorrow is too late.

The Lord makes the entrance exams hard so we'll know right away if you've got what it takes.

It's kind of like being born: It's a crisis experience that the mother and baby go through. If they can make that they can usually make the rest pretty well. From then on you just go step by step and grade by grade and it becomes a little more spread out, like the growth of a baby.

Lukewarm believers make God sick to his stomach. (Revelation 3:16) He says the double-minded are ""like the troubled sea when it cannot rest."" (Isaiah 57:20) I cannot comprehend people's hesitation in serving the Lord all the way! If he's worth serving at all, he's worth serving full time and with all that you have!

How about you? Are you ready to give up everything, in absolute loyalty, and full-time service to Jesus? Do you want to be part of the last great spiritual revolution? If so, it requires 100% dedication. Do or die! Amen?"

religion,lmwil4,Religion might be hardwired in the evolutionary psyche,"Religious behaviour appears to have evolved early in human history, as generally agreed by scientists. 

There are a couple of theories as to why religious behaviour was adopted so early on. 

**One is that religion itself was an adaptive mechanism which provided some sort of evolutionary advantage.** Religious behaviour may have enhanced cooperation and cohesion within groups, increasing chance of survival. One example is a case of 200 utopian communes in the 19th-century United States that were researched ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_of_religion#Religion_as_an_adaptation)) both religious and secular. 39 percent of the religious communes were still functioning 20 years after their founding while only 6 percent of the secular communes were. This *may* be used to demonstrate religion is an adaptive trait that enables cooperation and unity without kinship, which may have been a major cause for development and dominance of monotheism. Now our history has proven that religion has been the cause of many wars, but it also shows that religion, especially monotheism, has contributed to the survival and dominance of many large empires and cultures through social cohesion and personal sacrifice. 

**The other one is that religious beliefs may have emerged as a by-product of other adaptive traits without initially being adaptive trait in itself.** The enlargement of the human brain leading to higher consciousness forced humans to deal with the concept of personal mortality. Religion may have been one solution to this problem. Additionally, psychological mechanisms such as the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm, the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events, and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions (theory of mind) allowed human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, such as thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life."

religion,lmt5yl,"Why couldn't God just forgive us, why did he have to allow the suffering of Christ?","So, I'm writing a paper on philosophy and religion, and the deeper ! look into this, the grayer things seem to get.

Whether that's because I have been in an echo chamber, or because I'm merely afraid of going to hell, I do. I think that somehow, he came to atone for our sins. That's not the part I have questions about, I'm pretty set on it.  
However, why could a 'loving and forgiving' god not just forgive us himself? Why did he send someone to suffer? He claims to love us, but continuous inflicts pain and suffering upon us. And, when he's not inflicting it himself, he's allowing someone else to inflict it. He is supposed to be a loving parent, yet stands to the side, allowing us to go through atrocities. He is supposed to be all power, supposed to be loving, yet he sends his own 'son' as a sacrifice to purify us of our sins?

I always end up going back to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/isuzzr/the_bibles_claim_that_god_is_love_is_false_by_the/) detailing the hypocrisy of god. He has impossible standards that not even he meets.

So, was Jesus just a pawn? He was sent for the purpose to atone for our sins, something God could of done himself, but made the decision not to. He allowed suffering when he could of stopped it, even allowing it on his OWN SON. Jesus wept in the garden the day before his crucifixion, showing that he didn't want to suffer, but God did not help him. So, why?"

It's fricking impossible to figure out which one is true. It seems like the only way to go to heaven is to die as a small kid who didn't even get a chance to choose her/his religion. And if you change your religion and the religion you abandoned was actually true then you probably will anger the god you refused to believe and will be sent to hell. And what if they are all not true and other alien civilizations are believing in the correct religion??? And even if you get REALLY LUCKY but be a bad person, you still go to hell.

Now I understand the 15 year old atheist who just shouts gods a lie i understand why many people including more adult atheist don't like him but today at work I overheard a very interesting conversation. An associate was talking about getting back together with his girlfriend and it came up that she was an atheist. With this revelation came an uproar from the group I was working with many you should just leave her comments were made but one comment really stood out. On of my friends said ""thats some of that devil worshipping shit"" and at that very moment I knew that many people don't know how to feel about atheist. I was working with the group and spoke up asking what the big deal was explaining that atheism is just a disbelief in an afterlife and I explained that I was agnostic and what that meant. They asked me a couple of basic questions like so you don't believe that anyone knows what happens and I said no. But after the conversation died down the man who's girlfriend we were talking about said ""God put me on this earth to save her"" and to a Christian I'm sure this sounds like a very noble thing to say but to me a former atheist i knew this was a bad idea. Being preached to is not on a list of things that will bring an atheist back to religion and claiming to be their savor is incredibly condescending and only works to push them away not just from the religion but from you because to them your just another religious nut at that point. This was a strange experience for me watching the reaction they had to an atheist and it reminded me of when I was alot younger and my dad took me to his friends house for a cook out and on the way there it came up that he was an atheist. Me being a good little 10 year old Baptist was honestly scared but now that I'm older i have to ask why? Why is there such a fear or disgust of atheist? Why do Christians feel as tho they are the ones to save them when they have made their decision? I can understand the feeling of needing to save people from hell but take it from me all your constant attempts to save atheist just kinda makes you seem crazy to them because they don't believe what you do."

I was raised Catholic but fell out of it at a young age so I'm an atheist with little memory on catholicism. If I offend anyone by my question, simplification or phrasing, it's unintentional, I'm just genuinely curious about the dynamic. So if christians believe you go to hell for committing sin with atonement, shouldn't the devil be viewed with respect as the one who punishes those who didn't lead a properly faithful life? I understand that it is god who you pray to and guides your faith but is it not also the fear of being in the hands of satan that also keep your faith aligned? I guess what I'm trying to convey is that it seems like God is the good cop and Satan is the bad; naturally the bad is feared and usually disliked but has a comparable role and responsibility. Don't both provide reason to lead your life according to religion? There's a positive motivation and a negative motivation, I'm sure most are more driven by one but why is the devil viewed as so bad? And isn't he a fallen angel? What if he didn't switch ""sides"" and instead realized there needed to be a reason to not be bad?

For Christians, things may get a little easier, but in fact Christianity is sometimes very Earth-centric. How would the Bible and all be interpretated with people living in Space? Does Jesus have any power outside Earth? In the case of Catholicism how would space be hanged when it comes to dioceses and all that stuff?

So I grew up in a Christian community--specifically an evangelical one. As someone who was drawn to academics, though, my teenage and ultimately my young adult years have become a constant wrestle with the angels, in a sense. Trying to reconcile a theological framework with a reductionist scientific one is an incredibly, incredibly hard task, but somehow it seems irresponsible and complacent to reject that struggle. To me it seems obvious that science isn't going anywhere--it has way too much to offer us. The same can be said for religion, in my opinion. The problem is that these two communities don't seem to want to play nice at all--and for good reason. They're perspectives that frame the world from diametrically opposed position. Religion is top down, and science is bottom up. Religion deals with ethics and the way the world should be from an abstract ideal expressed through religious narrative, liturgy, and art, science tells us what the world is according to a mass of particular data pieces and amalgamated structures of data. 

I decided to start a podcast this year trying to work on learning how to get better at making sense between hardline disconnected positions like this that all toof frequently fall into a pattern of talking past each other. I want to learn how to get better and translating our jargon-based dialects and working toward a useful dialectic. 

In this episode I sat down with my neighbour, who I found out is a lit professor at Laurier University. We talked about modernism and postmodernism, and making sense of religion, gender roles, and grand metanarratives in the moment we find ourselves in.

religion,ll1i77,how my religious oppinion has changed over time.,"  

I am just going to talk a bit about religion and what impact it has made on my life. my mother and father are not religious, but they used to be. My mother was a follower of the catholic church I don’t know which branch she is from however she did read the old testament as a kid, and later turned into a Buddhist as she was put off by all the murder in the bible. my dad was a Jehovah witness you know the annoying polite guys that knock on your door. Both of them are now no longer religious and because of that they never forced me into believing in any religion. We still celebrated religious traditions like Christmas because giving gifts to your loved ones is nice.

Growing up I did not think much of religion it was not something I knew or cared about so I did not have an opinion on it all that religion was were those well produced religious cartoons for children. However, after a while I began to think about religion specifically the religious movies and films that I grew up watching and one thought began to dominate my mind is god an asshole? God supposedly made the entire world so that would mean that he is be responsible for all the bad things that have happened on earth. Hitler, ww1, ww2 and all other kinds of tragedies that god has allowed. This caused me to go from not caring about religion to disliking religion “oh and to clarify I was about 10 at this time”.

However, what really made me really dislike religion is the way it brainwashes and indoctrinates children into becoming mindless slaves. Okay that might be a bit of an over exaggeration or is it? While a child is still young it has a capacity of learning that is unmatched by any adult and whatever you teach it at that young of an age the child will believe whole heartedly. This is what turned me off from religion it made me believe that by growing up in a religious family a child is less likely to be creative and learn a new way of thinking as they grow up. 

At this point in my life I began to really really really dislike religion however what made me hate it is when I began to read and understand history because I realized that religion is not only a bad practice that indoctrinates children but also been the cause of millions of deaths across the globe “sorry flat earthers”. This is when I began to despise religion and the people that practice it. this was the point in time that if you told me that you were religious I would get angry. However, over time I began to get less angry at religion and I just began to poke fun at it. The ridiculous contradictions the murder and the over all bad writing in the bible and many other religious books. And this is also when I first tried to read the bible and I ended up getting bored to death and gave up on reading it. However recently I have taken to reading the old testament and it has been a much more engaging read. While the new testament lamp shades the murder and the not safe for work aspects of the bible the old testament revels in the murder and sex. In what other book would murdering countless innocent civilians and chopping of their dongs be considered a good thing.

The old testament has convinced me that god is an asshole and does not give two shits about the wellbeing of us humans he lets people die even his most devote followers and can judge a newborn child as a sinner and kill it. I have no clue how people can think that god is a good guy because time and again he makes the lives of his creations pure hell.

this has been my religious journey so far and I hope that you took the time to read it all you probably didn’t however if you did and are seeing this thank you for reading."
religion,ll086j,How Reality Manifests in Creation,"The creative power of God manifests in Nature in various ways. Our scriptures suggest the various methods by which reality manifests in the world. Some of them are used in Creation by God through Nature. Some are used by us in ritual and spiritual practices. These methods can be used by us in our daily lives.

Since our minds and bodies are products of Nature, we have the same creative power to manifest reality. However, it does not fully manifest in us due to limitations in our knowledge, thinking, reasoning, perception, etc. Hence our ability to create or manifest reality remains limited or dormant in most cases. However, we can improve it through study and observation or spiritual transformation.

The following methods by which reality manifest in the world are found in our scriptures such as the Samhitas, the Upanishads, the Puranas and the Bhagavadgita. Creative power, ability or potential is different from creativity. By creativity we mean the ability to solve problems and find solutions in innovative ways, whereas the creative ability refers to the ability to manifest reality or desired outcomes. They may be interconnected, but this discussion is about the methods by which reality manifests in the world by our own efforts (adhyatmika) or with the help of gods (adhi daivika) and others (adhibhautika)."

religion,lkuqj8,How to find myself a new religion?,"I recently had a fight with my dad that kinda ended up being like the ‘last straw’ for me. My dad is very strictly religious and I’ve been brought along for the ride my whole life without option, including me and my siblings all getting pressured into being baptized. This last fight (and by fight I mean he yelled at me while I tried not to cry) was literally about the fact that he didn’t think I was ‘respecting him’ right. He thought my attitude was bad (which I firmly believe wasnt and was nothing he should have blown up over) over a simple matter and that I was disrespectful even though it’s not something he would be upset about if my brothers did (woo, sexism!). He thinks that he was being ‘so nice’ and I was being ignorant, disrespectful and rude. 

After this last fight, I’ve been rethinking my religious standing (finally, felt like I was avoiding this). I’m not sure I want to just abandon faith completely, but I’m really tired of being in this religion that for me, is so associated with my dad (who I dislike in case you didn’t notice). For him, Christianity justifies his authority over all of us and makes him think he’s always right, he’s such a ‘godly man’, etc. 

I have to say that indeed I wasn’t all happy and treating him like he was some superior like he wanted I guess, but I’m usually very careful about how I act around him and put up a fake nice front to avoid getting in trouble. I had been stressed, and maybe my front was down a bit (although not completely). Getting back to the religious aspect, my main problem is that he acts as if he deserves total respect simply for being a religious man, that the father is the head of the household, very strictly following the ‘parents must be obeyed and respected in every way’ type deal. Lots of sexism and traditional views. I realized finally that I was tired of this religion because I didn’t want to be a part of something that somehow enabled my dad to act this way, and that I was tired of him preaching about being a ‘good’ person and yet having no patience, doing nothing around the house (my poor mom :( oof ) and yet blowing his fuse at me over something as simple as my ‘attitude’, mind you I’m an 18F who has learned her lesson about how to act in front of her parents. I can assure you I wasn’t being immature or whining, complaining, demanding anything unnecessary. I later overheard him talking to my mom about how horrible I was, that I was making it all up, and how nice he was being despite it all- I’m being antagonized and I have no chance to explain my frustration or how I feel he is wrong because I’m the child in this relationship. He’s right, I’m wrong, this is what the bible has made him believe throughout my entire childhood. 

I’m not abandoning my faith entirely, I’m just so so tired of forcing myself to be a part of something I hate and associate with so negatively all because I can’t tell my parents (mostly dad) that I don’t want to go along with what they’ve been forcing into me. Is it fair to say I want to find a new religion that i can actually believe in myself? Christianity has just become such a mental trauma for me and while I want to force myself to believe, I almost hate myself for doing it because I simply cannot stand my dad and what has become ´his religion’ and way of parenting. 

I don’t want to sound bratty, but it feels like he’s ‘ruined’ this religion for me, in that it has simply become associated with terrible childhood memories (including one where he tried to perform an ‘exorcism’ on my sister who is now an atheist). 

TLDR: not Christian by choice, i don’t want to follow Christianity because of my dad’s actions but I dont want to abandon my faith entirely either. Interested in other religions maybe? 

Sorry for the long rant. I really have no one in my life I can tell this too, and I’m just so tired of keeping it in me. I guess I’m just mentally exhausted and this was a final blow. If you think I’m being immature or this is all my fault, please just skip my post. Thanks everyone in this subreddit."

religion,lkpthf,Fishing and Reading the Bible Part II: Humanity in Exodus,"\- A couple days ago I began the Bible, in the hopes I can attempt to make it through the holy books. Genesis seemed to show me the importance of God's relationship with man early on, and I tried to keep that theme at the forefront of my mind while reading Exodus. Exodus is the second Book by the ancient prophet Moses (supposedly) written circa 6th or 5th century B.C., detailing Israel's 400 year bondage under Egypt, and afterwards deliverance. We see the plagues, the Ten Commandments, the Law, and deliverance. Easy to understand why so many films have been made of this famous Biblical story.

\- I have always found the world a place of such great mystery. Even the depths of the lake seem dark and dangerous, a world I am unable to imagine or inhabit. In reading the wonders that the Lord supposedly wrought on Egypt, the sensationalist in me tried to picture what that would actually look like being present during that time. Locusts that blot out the sky. A darkness that the Bible says could be felt. Imagine being an Egyptian and witnessing your rivers changed to blood, or listening to the wailings and cries of a once great civilization, as firstborns are found slain and butchered in their beds. Terrifying, and whether you believe it or not, an incredibly riveting story. Even the Red Sea peeling back to allow Israel to escape, and Pharaoh to meet his doom as great whales and sharks spectate suspended inside their auditorium of tides. What did that look like? Who would possibly even pursue Israel at that point? Sensational optics.

\- I want to focus on the relationships between God and the two distinct peoples in this Book. I want to start with God's interactions with the Egyptians first, because I think it gets lost that God seems to really care how the Egyptian people see him. I think it's part of the reason God goes to all of this trouble with the plagues, to show them the weaknesses of the various Egyptian gods whom theoretically should be able to combat God. In Exodus, none can stand up to God, nor Egypt's apparently powerful magicians. Aside note, big laughs at the magicians turning the bloody rivers into, um, more bloody rivers? Magic does seem to have a certain power in these times which is interesting. Anyway, God reiterates that He wants the Egyptians to know He is God. I don't really believe the Egyptians are the bad guys here, but a society led by a selfish ruler. Historically, it's worthwhile to consider Exodus into the interactions between these ancient nations. Egypt already had played a prominent role in Genesis with Pharaoh's interactions with Abraham, Isaac and especially Joseph, as well as the role Hagar plays. Egypt seems to carry an importance to God. I would love to read some of ancient Egypt's texts soon.

\-Question: was Pharaoh evil to an incompetent degree, or was he more a pawn of the Lord in order that He may show His power to Egypt? If that's the case, is Pharaoh really at fault for Egypt's misfortunes?

\- The relationship between God and Israel hits me the most. Colorful, dead leaves swirl around my feet, as another season begins to change. I think of relationships past and present, of those whom I've held dear. Seasons change, feelings change, hearts change. But God desires this intimacy to Israel, saving them, delivering them, caring for them, having mercy and love towards them, favoring them... and time and again it just isn't enough. I've been there, I've feel that. They murmur about God, and Moses whom God deals with as He would a friend. This after 400 years of hard slavery in Egypt. It's wild, but honestly very real. We are all cheaters, or been cheated on, or have been unfaithful or disloyal. We've had loved ones turn on us, hurt us. Turned on them. Most of us have seen one or both sides of the coin, and in this I can relate to God and Israel. God saves them, yet they create and worship a golden calf. Love is hard. God seems to care about the heart attitude of true belief, and yet so many times, like our own relationships, love just seems so difficult. Miracles and wonders aren't even enough to sway the hearts of those you love. That makes me incredibly sad.

\- Sidenote, The Bible loves arks. Noah's ark, Moses' ark as a baby, now the Ark of the Covenant. All symbolize escape from destruction and delivery. Don't sleep with animals. Don't work on the Sabbath. Don't let your ox gore someone more than once. Have no leaven bread. A lot of rules and regs we today do not understand, but are interesting nonetheless. I read somewhere the painting of the doorways in blood so the Angel of Death ""passes over"" a dwelling symbolizes the cross (a hyssop dab of blood at the top and sides of the frame). Interesting thought.

\- Bezaleel is my dude, that guy does everything."

religion,lko2qu,"When you he Dalai Lama dies, his reincarnation will be a religious crisis. Here’s what could happen",
religion,lknvtr,Do religions need to be updated? How?,"A religion like Christianity or Islam is not supposed to change. After all it's the word of God. The word of God is by definition perfect, so no update is needed.

Honestly this idea is to my admittedly tiny brain the worst flaw of many religions.

Cultures change as the environment changes or cause of perceived flaws in the culture. 
This transformation seems to be the work of creatives, who explore the unknown and bring home the meat (if people want to hear it). They also seem to be more aware of 'where society will go if we continue this road.'

Many of these ideas are based on Jordan Peterson's interpretation on the psychology of religion btw.

Religion is a tool, a map to a particular destination. If the map is flawed, it's only natural to update it.

So you can see religion as a body of creative work with the ultimate goal of improving our lives. Some ideas may be judged as flawed, and are updated. The new testament is for example an update to the old testament as Jesus changes some of the rules the Jews lived by and seemed less happy about conquering. Some medieval monk even changed the ending of one of the gospels to improve the narrative. (People who know more about the bible can correct me) Plus there were obscure bible books that weren't canonized.

Nowadays, many people hold onto their religious beliefs as 100% perfect. But what if there are some flaws in there? Will they never get sifted out? Do people need to see the consequences of those flaws with their own eyes? And if they do, will they lose faith in God as a whole, as his word was evidently not perfect like they were taught?

I am also not an atheist that believes the world would be better off without religion. Religion is the foundation of society. Without a foundation, the house gets destroyed. 
You can make up an ideology as a foundation. But unlike religion, the bugs haven't been worked out through a centuries-long painful trial and error. Ideologies are utopian and do not take everything in account. Not saying religion is perfect at this, but I suspect it's better at it.

So, what if people started believing that their holy book was inspired by God, yes, but not 100% God. At the end of the day it still came through a fallible human with an ego and limited knowledge. This doesn't mean God isn't real it just mean we are on a continual journey to know him.

The problem arises then in knowing whether a person is qualified in updating your holy book. In native American tribes, people had ways of figuring out whether someone is meant to be a shaman. I don't know where I read that but it seems world religions or people in general should be skilled in this too.

""You shall know them by their fruits"" Jesus would say in judging a prophet.

Does this new 'prophet' have to perform physical miracles though? As the story goes, of course, Jesus did. I have the intuition that some people may truly be capable of miracles through God and even through the Devil. 
I personally think there's enough proof for a spiritual realm beyond- but linked with, the psychological if you're willing to look for it.

This post might be all over the place but I hope it sparks interesting discussion and that maybe you learned something from it."

One of things that strikes me is that ancient religions and paganism appear to have a resurgence, but this could just be my perception. If true, such an effect may be due to liberalization of belief in modern society and dissatisfaction towards Abrahamic faiths and society models, and subsequent romanticization of ancient religions.

I'm also fascinated by how much Abrahamic faiths have borrowed from ancient religions. The idea of Jinn in Islam for instance; these other worldly beings that are invisible to humans and, unlike angels, have free will and are fallible, not innately evil or good, have human desires and qualities (can even raise families of their own), and have super natural abilities; the Jinn seem to have hints of Mesopotamian pagan deities. Burnt offerings in altars in the Old Testament, and Jesus's sacrifice for our sins, are other example of pagan influences in Abrahamic faiths. Even the recurrence of the number seven in Abrahamic texts appear to be influenced by ancient Mesopotamian astrology.

Are polytheism and paganism on the rise? 

Does this concern monotheists? If so, is this because Abrahamic followers believe pagan deities actually exist and channelling them would be dangerous for the world, or do they believe these deities don't exist and worshipping them is just baseless idol worship? I've heard some Abrahamics even say resurgence of paganism is one of the signs of the end times.

What do pagans and polytheists think about this?"

Iv had it explained to me a million different ways from a million different people in a million denominations. They say your sin will weight you down or not believing is a rejection of God's love ext ext. But that means now matter how much I try I'm screwed because even when I was younger and frequently in church I was skeptical and now that I'm older its next to impossible to not see the natural causes for the things that so many call acts of God.
   Iv brought this up to people that I can't force myself to believe but they say that God will see my attempt and let me in anyway. But no that's not how it works because if that was how it worked they wouldn't bash theistic agnostics. I get so many different sides catholics seem to be the most convinced they are right and will often turn to insulting me when I press them on the issue some of them even telling me that other Christian based denominations are damnd to hell as well.
   I grew up Baptist with a methodist mother who later turned pagan not like the moon cycle dream catchers type but the we are made of energy from the earth and our energy will return to the earth type. I watched as my religious grandmother screamed at her when she reviled her religious affiliation. I'm not sure what my dad is anymore hell we had a discussion that makes me think he is more on the agnostic path like me, not sure what to believe anymore. 
   Sometimes I pray but I can't say why or to what, most of them start with ""if your really up there"" i guess its just something leftover from my religious upbringing idk but sometimes it makes me feel better. But idk its just the more I look into it the less it makes sense. I'm agnostic and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon and to most I'm sure that means I am hell bound but I can't get a straight answer so excepting the unknown of it all seems like my only option right now. I can't bring my self to believe that simply anyone can go to hell you can't tell me a just God let's a good man rot with the murderers.if hell is real it must be prison like with some chance of escape thats the only way it could remain a just system of punishment. And if God is all powerful then he could easily make hell like that could he not.
    Well there it is my two cents on the matter and I'm willing to read comments as long as you don't preach to me with Bible verses and try to sell me you denominations. And any my mother and father are damnd comments will be left unread as well."

religion,lk3k3k,Do Jews believe in a devil?,"Just to make it clear what I'm talking about, in modern Christianity there is an ultimate villain of sorts called 'the devil'. He's also known as Satan and Lucifer. In Christianity, its said he was once the most beautiful of all the angels who, though once loyal to God, tried to overthrow him. A third of the angels in heaven sided with him. Obviously, his attempt failed and he and all the angels that sided with him were cast out of heaven. All the other angels that were cast out with Lucifer became demons. 

As for the character of Satan, he is simply pure, absolute evil. He only ever does wrong, and never does anything good. I've heard a lot of Christians say he picks on humanity because its the only way he can get back at God. The character has also long been identified as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, though some people have pointed out that the Bible never actually says such. Nothing good comes of anything that involves the devil, in fact, his involvement always makes things much, much worse. He's literally the most evil being in existence, and its simply impossible to more more evil than him.

All I know about the history of the character is that he was once seen as an ally of God (as evidenced by his depiction in the Book of Job), but later his reputation changed and he eventually became the much hated character Christians know today.

However, I have no idea when this change in the perception of the character occurred. In particular, I have no idea if this change occurred before or after the split with Judaism. 

So, does Judaism have anything equivalent to this character? I know his two 'names', Satan and Lucifer, are both Hebrew in origin. The word Satan is supposedly descended from an ancient Hebrew word that was something like 'shaitan', meaning 'adversary' or 'opponent'. Lucifer's name literally translated as 'light bringer' (Christians often say this is the name he had before he betrayed God). The word Lucifer itself obviously isn't technically Hebrew, but it is Latin for 'light bringer', so its a literal translation of an originally Hebrew term. Similarly, the Greek word 'Phosphoros' translates the same. This leads me to believe that the character existed when most Christians still knew Hebrew, though I have no idea when that period ended. Christians were also more entwined with Judaism during the religion's early years. Early Christians saw themselves as Jews, they went to temple, ate Kosher and followed all the other rules of Judaism, etc... Historians today call these people 'Jewish Christians' in fact. I don't believe it wasn't until the fourth or fifth century that Christianity truly split from Judaism and began to evolve along its own, separate path.

So, does Judaism have a 'devil' in any form?"
religion,lk0tbp,Why does Lucifer get such a bad rap?,"Bear with me I’ll try and sum up this big question/analysis I’ve been sitting on for a while now. 

So according to the Judeo-Christian Creation story, God created Angels in which to do its bidding. Angels were not given free will. They were created to obey God unquestioningly. Therefore we can say that any action an Angel took was at the behest of God. As such the “rebellion” was wasn’t really a rebellion. And even after Lucifer “Falls” and becomes the devil, he is still subservient to God. For example in the story of Job, the devil straight up asks God’s permission to torture Job and doesn’t do anything until God gives him the go ahead. 

So why the bad rap on the devil? He’s just doing what he was told to do. He literally CAN’T do anything for himself.

The Biblical authors rewrote using already existing original Egyptian and ANE (Ancient Near East) religious texts for the writing of Proverbs.

Below I will give you some of the reasons why it is the majority academic consensus that the Bible's book of Proverbs is merely a copy of the original *Teachings of Amenemope.*

*Do not befriend the heated man, Not approach him for conversation*."" (Amenemope chapter 9).

""Don't answer the foolish arguments of fools, or you will become as foolish as they are."" (Prov. 26:4)

\------------------

“Do not rob the poor because he is poor,

Or crush the afflicted at the gate” (Proverbs 22:22).

“Guard yourself from robbing the poor

From being violent to the weak” (Amenemope iv, 4–5).

\------------------

“For wealth certainly makes itself wings

Like an eagle that flies toward the heavens” (Proverbs 23:5).

“They \[dishonest riches\] make themselves wings like geese,

And fly to heaven” (Amenemope x, 5)

\------------------

""Don't cheat your neighbor by moving the ancient boundary markers; don't take the land of defenseless orphans. For their Redeemer is strong; he himself will bring their charges against you."" (Prob 23:10-11)

Do not remove the boundary of stone of the cultivated land. Nor throw down the boundary of the widow. (Amenemope VII, 12).

\------------------

""Don't wear yourself out trying to get rich. Be wise enough to know when to quit. Just blink your eyes and wealth is gone, for it will sprout wings and fly away like an eagle."" (Prov 23:4-5)

Do not strain to seek excess

When your possessions are secure

If riches are brought to you by robbert

They will not stay the night in your possession

When the day dawns they are no longer in your house.

Their place can be seen but they are no longer there

The earth opened its mouth to crush and swallow them

And plunged them to Dust.

They make themselves a great hole, as large as they are.

And sink themselves in the underworld.

They make themselves wings like geese,

and fly to heaven. (Amenemope IX, 14--x, 5)

\------------------

""Don't cheat your neighbor by moving the ancient boundary markers; don't take the land of defenseless orphans. For their Redeemer is strong; he himself will bring their charges against you."" (Prob 23:10-11)

Do not remove the boundary of stone of the cultivated land. Nor throw down the boundary of the widow. (Amenemope VII, 12).

\------------------

There are more, but these will suffice. The most important of these parallels is what we find in **Amenemope xxvii, 7–8** and **Proverbs 22:20. Here we have a direct plagiarist copy, not even bothering to edit context in order to fit the Bible. See the two quotes:**

What is the academic consensus explaining what's going on in these 2 textual parallels below?

“Have I not written **thirty sayings** for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge?” (Proverbs 22:20)

compare this to:

“See for yourself these **thirty chapters**

They are pleasant, they educate” (Amenemope xxvii, 7–8).

Allow me to explain to you what the academic consensus is explaining what's going on in these 2 textual parallels.

**Thirty Sayings**

The “thirty sayings” is most likely: a) a phrase influenced by *Amenemope*’s “thirty chapters” and b) referencing thirty sayings within much of Collection III (though the exact thirty have been debated for a century). Know that some funky textual issues exist in Proverbs 22.20 which lead to unfortunate translations (like this [Gotquestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/Instruction-of-Amenemope.html) article does). But I won't get into it here. It’s safe to say that the phrase is almost definitely “thirty sayings.” To put it simply, the cut and paste of the ""thirty sayings"" makes no sense at all in the context of the Bible. The reason apologists give is not taken seriously by academics in this field, but is something Christians hold on to and believe since their favorite apologetics website said so.

There are four different hypotheses as to why these texts are so similar:

1. both have a common, older source
2. they use the same fund of Near Eastern proverbs, proverbs everyone knows
3. the biblical text is older and Amenemope is an expansion of it
4. the Egyptian text is a literary source of the Bible

The hypothesis that bears the least problems is the fourth: The first one does not explain the parallels throughout the texts (in contrast to only one paragraph). The parallels are too specific for the second to be true. And the Egyptian text is unequivocally older than the biblical. And there are observations that corroborate the fourth explanation as well (but they are difficult to explain and need more time and space than I can dedicate right now).

Think of the book of Proverbs as a collection of five collections, each with its own composition process, all assembled by a final editor(s). The portion of this question is concerned with is Collection III (Prov. 22.17–24.22), which can be further broken into IIIa (22.17–23.11) and IIIb (23.12–24.22). Collection IIIa (CIIIa from here) is what I’ll focus on, considering that the parallels to *Instruction of Amenemope* are found predominantly in this section of Proverbs.

**Dating**

In its early form, *Amenemope* is presumed to have been composed before 1100 BCE. For a moment, let’s assume that Solomon or his courts actually had something to do with CIIIa (fwiw Solomon had far less to do with the authorship of Proverbs than popularly taught). As attested by the Hebrew Bible, Solomon didn’t reign until 970 BCE. No formal drafting of Proverbs or CIIIa would have existed until at least that time. Therefore, as far as dating of authorship is concerned, CIIIa came a couple centuries after *Amenemope*. **There is no possibility that the Egyptian text is dependent upon Proverbs. The reverse is certainly possible.**

**Dependence versus copying**

I think it’s important to note the connotation of words used here. The author of CIIIa did not copy from *Amenenope* in the sense that we might think. Neighboring nations in the ancient Near East were known to collect and adapt wisdom traditions. It wouldn't be a surprise if an Israelite text was influenced by and dependent upon an Egyptian text. In other words, the author of CIIIa probably borrowed from the concepts, structure, and even phrasing of *Amenemope* yet **appropriated** the texts into their own Israelite context. He likely conformed some Egyptian wisdom sayings to fit within his covenant religion.

Also, dependence upon another nation's wisdom text doesn't negate the literary, cultural, and religious significance of CIIIa for Israel. Regarding this dependence, Dell writes:

&gt;""If there was an international literary tradition within which borrowing took place from one culture to another, it is credible, in my view, that influence of ideas took place... This does not, however, mean a whole-sale ‘sell-out’ to the Egyptian social context” (66).

But Christians will say their book is the Word of God, when an academic would say that this is merely how ANE (ancient near east) cultures write their books. Borrowing from older sources, and building upon already existing knowledge. It's all a matter of perspective, one that does not want to know about these things can think that their book is special.

**Which came first?**

The majority view for the better part of a century has been that CIIIa is dependent upon *Amenemope*. I'd say more on this (see sources below for more info), but instead will offer the alternative (and according to the majority consensus among academics, insufficient) view. Some scholars, predominantly John Ruffle and R. Norman Whybray, argue against the dependence of CIIIa upon *Amenenope*. Ruffle, for instance, argues that the authors of CIIIa and *Amenemope* arrived at similar proverbial conclusions due to their shared cultural experiences. There possibly existed a common wisdom tradition in the ancient Near East which both adopted—though attempts to show this have been unfruitful. Still, Ruffle acknowledges that CIIIa is likely inspired by *Amenemope*. Whybray goes further than Ruffle, contending that no dependence exists. In response, I recommend Emerton’s analysis of Ruffle’s and Whybray’s positions. He thoroughly demonstrates the weaknesses of their arguments in comparison with the prevailing views of dependence.

The Gotquestions apologetics article referenced doesn’t do Proverbs justice. That website as a whole is fairly skeptical of academic biblical studies--and most views other than those held by its authors. Apologists unfortunately start with a conclusion and make their way from there, but this is not science nor intelligent. I wouldn't rely on that site much, neither [Carm.org](https://carm.org/), especially if one is seeking answers to these sort of questions. There are many unbiased, educated academics in the field. But if one remains in one's own sphere of religion, containing all their thoughts to the Bible only, thinking that it is the true word of God, not desirous to know where the Biblical authors took their inspiration from, you will not know of these things.

Also notice that in the GotQuestions article, it will say that Solomon collected proverbs according to the Bible, and put them in order. The author of the apologetic piece says that this is fine, since ""all wisdom is from God"", yet here's the problem. The Bible authors plagiarized these words and instead attributed the wisdom to Yahweh instead of the Egyptian Gods. This isn't the only place where this sort of thing can be seen in the Bible, the stories come from older ones, but the Bible authors merely change the name of the gods. And then the apologetics author says, ""That's fine. It's all from our god anyway"".

The truth is that the sayings contained in these books of the ANE and any other religious system is common knowledge among experienced human beings. Human beings grow and learn, and they put the wisdom they have gotten throughout their lives and insert that into their religious texts. None of these are from heaven.

I didn’t cover everything but this is a good start. I encourage you all to continue to seek further understanding about the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures.

Additionally, here are some more parallels from the Bible to Ancient Near East texts:

**Proverbs 6:23-26 says:**

For their command is a lamp and their instruction a light; Their corrective discipline is the way to life. It will keep you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the promiscuous woman. Don't lust for her beauty. Don't let her coy glances seduce you. For a prostitute will bring you to poverty, but sleeping with another man's wife will cost you your life.

**Compare that Proverb with the following passages from other Near Eastern wisdom texts:**

**From Akkadian Counsels of Wisdom we read the following:**

Don't marry a prostitute, whose husbands are legion. Nor a temple harlot, who is dedicated to a goddess, nor a courtesan, whose intimates are numerous. She will not sustain you in your time of trouble, she will snigger at you when you are embroiled in controversy. She has neither respect nor obedience in her nature. Even if she has the run of your house, get rid of her. She has ears attuned for another's footfall.

**From Egyptian Instructions of Ani:**

Take a wife while you're young. That she make a son for you; she should bear for you while you're youthful. It is proper to make people. Beware of a woman who is a stranger. One not known in her town. Don't stare at her when she goes by, do not know her carnally. A deep water whose course is unknown. Such a woman away from her husband. ""I am pretty,"" she tells you daily, when she has no witnesses; she is ready to ensnare you, a great deadly crime when it is heard."

If you’re reading this, you’re probably among the former.

Your bills are paid. You are doing things that you love. You have resources left in your bank or wallet that allows you to pursue things you love.

And you are also consciously blind to the suffering of billions of others who have nothing.

It’s not like you can do anything about it either.

But I ask you, a being of magnificent biological engineering - who is able to conjure up intricate worlds through brush strokes, build entire universes using your mind, manage impossible feats of strength and agility - how different are you from someone who has nothing?

Perhaps that someone was lazy. He/she squandered away the gifts they were endowed with. Perhaps it was gambling, alcohol, drugs, crime, or just a lack of ambition.

However, you’re different.

You’ve managed to make it. You’ve conquered life’s obstacles and become a self-made person.

You deserve praise for that.

But I ask you again. How different are you really from someone who has nothing?

Reflect on that person’s background for a second. 

Their history. Their origin. What could have went so wrong in their lives that they’ve reached this current situation? Was it something they could have avoided? Was it something that someone or something else possibly caused?

What do you have in common with this particular person who is so many millions of miles away and hasn’t possibly eaten for three days?

Perhaps you’re blessed with lineage. Your ancestors were wise prudent enough to set up systems that would take care of their progeny.

Perhaps you’ve more skills that someone else in a profitable industry and that enables you to productively use those skills towards the realization of your objectives - whether its to pay off bills or debts, take care of your responsibilities, or just save up for that vacation.

Do you see there could be the remotest possiblity that there could be something in common between the two of you? 

It’s not something like that tired of cliche of flesh, blood, and tears.

I will leave you with that for now.

religion,ljfnki,Reading the Bible Chronologically while I fish,"\-I started this series a few months ago on r/books and r/Christianity. I haven't gotten much feedback so I am going to post my readings here as well. I'm currently on Judges, so I am not too far ahead from the time I originally wrote this.

\-I began a new hobby of reading while I fished, and it has enhanced both activities to a degree I find pure pleasure in. I read The Book of Eels last week while angling, and this week I decided to begin the Bible simply because I want to make it through all of the world's most important books before I die one day. It was a sunny, yet windy day in Connecticut, and being on the water brought peace with the readings.

\-Genesis is thought to be the first of a 5 part series by the ancient author and prophet Moses. As the name implies, it is a book of beginnings and origins. I am a believer in science, and wholeheartedly proclaim that evolution has been life's ultimate super-power, yet I found the stories of Creation and Adam to be quite intimate. I think metaphorically speaking, there is a lot to unpack, and I don't really find too much strife between Creation and Evolution if one looks at the Genesis story as alligorical. I mean the sun isn't even created until the 4th day, so obviously we aren't talking about stict 24 hour days of creation here. It made me pause to appreciate the aquatic world around me, especially with the autumn season causing the vibrant trees to mirror off the lake. God seems to have had aspirations of having an intimate relation with us, his prized creation, and I think in this day and age that gets lost on us amongst all the arguments of who is right and wrong, and damned or saved. This right here is the crux of Genesis and the Bible, and maybe even the Spirit world. All other themes aside, that is beautiful.

\-In Genesis, we see the first sin, the first murder, the first civilizations, the first prophecies, the first judgements, and so forth. We see lineages who follow the God of the Bible interacting with tribes who follow other religions. I think for the fan of history, that is incredibly valuable. Even of one is not a believer, this Book has an immense amount of historical worth. 50 chapters of one of the oldest writings, and yet it takes so much effort even to crack open these Books of Spirituality in modern times. We don't see the holy Books as a necessary read much anymore, and often talking about them has become taboo. We are missing out. Even reading chapter 49, wowsers. So much mystery in antiquity.

\- Several pumpkinseed sunfish slowly waft by. I untangle the concept of the Trinity as I also untangle my line. I think I get it. God says ""Let us make man in OUR image"" meaning God is at least a multi-set being. Assuming God is the traditional Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) if we are a reflection of God, we should be triune ourselves. Physically, we have a body (Son) and with the Breath of Life a soul (Father). I suppose our Spirit would be our personalities, or that which seperates us as individuals? I am not sure, but I think the concept isn't as messy as some believe it to be.

\- The true Scriptures are graphic. We forget the stories of Dinah or Tamar. The Children of Israel are also chuckleheads who luckily are blessed because of the faith of their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel who could be a clown himself. The heroes of Genesis are pretty ordinary mistake makers like you and I, outside of maybe Abraham and Joseph. The warriors of the Iliad, they are not. God's holy line of believers were pretty brutal- Dinah is raped or taken to wife by a non-Hebrew prince, and to exact vengeance they decieve him and his kingdom into being circumsized by the Hebrew custom, and slay them all as they are sore and recovering. That's some Game of Thrones work there.

\- Through it all, Genesis sets us on a foundation where the rest of the Bible will build. I watch my line blow lazily in the breeze as the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. A lot is said through the subtle and the simple. We live in a world now seemingly rife with chaos, and yet the ingredients are still there in nature and the spiritual realm to find peace and comfort. I didn't catch shit today, but that's ok. Abraham waited over 100 years for his promised son, and was asked in a test, to slay him. While the Bible may not always be taken literally, Genesis shows us the truths behind patience and sacrifice. And love. Maybe even faith.

\-I hope I have not offended anyone by my new report. I would be interested in hearing some viewpoints or things I may have missed. Keep your lines tight. The cold October waves still yield plenty of trout if one has faith. Stay blessed, and find your nature."

This is the realm of study of the Muslim philosophers, who basically shaped the western world. These are ""natural theologians"", similar to the western concept of the ""natural philosopher"", and it is from them that the famous [Five Proofs or Five Ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ways_(Aquinas) for the existence of God came from, namely al-Farabi.


* Doubt about God is a modern concept. The people who were trying to prove the existence of God already believed in God. It was not to compensate for a lack of faith as we see today, but rather that faith in God should have the foundation of reason. For this reason, Islamic philosophy became preponderant. It was an attempt to make ['aql](https://thehadithdisciple.wordpress.com/2019/02/16/reason-and-revelation-aql-naql/) or reason supplement and reinforce [naql](https://thehadithdisciple.wordpress.com/2019/02/16/reason-and-revelation-aql-naql/) or revelation.


* Al-Maturidi came from a land where Buddhism was the dominant religion. Shaykh Hamza Yusuf argues that Buddhism saved the Muslims with respect to maintaining Islam. In his paper he tried to show that the paradoxical formulas that are introduced by the Maturidis and Ash'aris are actually coming out of Buddhist logic. The Buddhists had a massive impact on Abbasid tolerance. This is because the [Barmakids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmakids), the great ministers of the Abbasids, were from Afghanistan, and that family was a famous Buddhist priestly family known for their tolerance. They introduced into Islamic thought doctrines of tolerance justified by Qur'anic interpretation thereby removing some of the harsher interpretations that found their way into Islamic thought. 


* There are multiple textual interpretations possible, so the question is, which interpretation are you going to choose? This is said to be a reflection of your own essential nature. What are you attracted to? You can find harsh interpretations in all religions, but you can also find positive qualities or interpretations, which are the dominant and authentic qualities of religion. The harsher and cruel qualities are like a Jungian shadow religion that exists alongside the true religion to almost separate people; just like the shadow qualities in a person represent separation and distance from one's true essential nature, which causes a person to be a contradictory person or a hypocrite, the shadow religion also represents distance and separation from its true essential nature, which also demonstrates a moral hypocrisy as well. After all, what is religion except the expression of man's nature? 


* The three men credited with formulating Islam as a codified religion all exist at the same time, which is proof of a Divine Providential care for Islam. They all die around the same time as well. These three men formulate these creeds that save Islam. [Imam at-Tahawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Tahawi) is more of a naqli scholar, he is not as interested in 'aql. [Abu Hasan al-Ash'ari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ash%27ari) is in a sense a bridge between 'aql and naql. But [al-Maturidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Mansur_al-Maturidi) takes it to a much deeper level in terms of the fundamental problem. What is interesting is the great creedal formula of the Muslims becomes the formula of [Imam al-Nafasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Mu%27in_al-Nasafi) who was a Maturidi with the commentary of [Imam Taftazani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Taftazani) who was an Ash'ari. 


* These three men, that is at-Tahawi, al-Ash'ari, and al-Maturidi, represent what comes to be known as Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. They basically create creeds; credo in Latin means ""I believe"", so a creed is what what you believe. This is why in the beginning of these creeds they say ""Aqulu mu'thaqudhan"". So the [Aqida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqidah) is what you are bound to, it's what you have conviction about. It's what you believe in with conviction. This becomes the Aqida an-Nafasiya, the Aqida at-Tahawiya, the Aqida al-Ash'ariah, etc.


* Imam abu Jafar, Imam at-Tahawi are the two Hanafis and Imam al-Maturidi was either Shafi'i or Maliki. However, his greatest student was abu Bakr al-Thaqalani, who was a Maliki scholar who developed the Atomic Theory in Islam. It is probably the most sophisticated pre-modern theory, which is mentioned in the book ""The History of the Atom"". The scientists who wrote that admit it is the most sophisticated pre-modern theory that we have, but were perplexed how the Muslims got that, which was most likely influenced through the Muslim-Buddhist interactions as they also have a sophisticated atomic theory as well.


* The Hanbalis were a fourth strain, and although al-Ashari would use Imam Ahmad as his foundation because, in a sense, he was considered by many as the Imam of the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah because of the role he played in protecting Islam from the Mutazilites. The three Imams (Abu Hanifa, Imam Malik, and Imam Shafi'i) have more room for 'aql, and Imam Abu Hanifa is considered the most rational, he is considered a legal philosopher in a way. Abu Hanifa will use 'aql more than the other three Imams whereas ibn Hanbal is considered the least rational in the sense that he will prefer a weak hadith over analogical reasoning. This is in his madhab, which refutes the lie that weak hadith have no place in Islam. On the contrary, weak hadith have been used by our greatest scholars.


* The Hanbali strain is the least inclined to use a rational approach to creed, and it gets to the point where the problem of the anthropomorphist - people who take things literally - begin to take position. Anthropomorphism has been a problem in all religions or religious communities. It is a universal phenomenon people that take a literal approach to everything that is said, which is impossible to do with any revealed text because the nature of language is that there is always analogy and metaphor. Language by its nature is symbolic. This is why the literalists always run into huge problems when they try to interpret the Qur'an and tend to engage in elaborate mental gymnastics to explain verses and overcome obvious contradictions. 


* 'Aql and naql is what al-Maturidi attempted to bring together. The third formulation is amongst the people who deal with Ihsan or the spiritual science of Islam. The providential care that we see in the community is the emergence of al-Harith al-Hasibi, al-Junaid (the great formulator of the tradition), al-Shibly who is his student, abu Talib al-Meki, and then Rabia al-Adhawiyah, who introduced the knowledge that Love for God is higher than Fear of God. This is considered an important introduction because the men had become too consumed by Fear of God. 


* Islam (the Four Imams), Iman (these four traditions), and Ihsan (these four Imams, and Rabi'a as the fifth), formulate what we would call 'religion' in the sense that we can study it and organize it in a schematized way. That was not true in the first community of Muslims because much of it was experiential. The Sahabah knew all these things, but they did not have the sort of categories and organizational structure we have today that developed out of the works of the great formulators of religion.


* We have the creed, which is naql, but then you have to have an understanding of it, which is 'aql. Faqr ad-Din al-Farabi says this is one of the meanings of ""Light upon Light""; it is the Light of revelation of upon intellect. He said that you should never be impressed with a person's Islam until you have tested their intellect. The most dangerous thing you can have is intellect without religion or religion without intellect. Both are disasters; intellect without religion leads to concentration camps, gas chambers, etc. Anybody can identify a problem (which can be a people) and then use pure reason to solve that problem. You can use the unchained intellect to rationalize anything using logic and reason.
 

* In the Kantian moral argument for the existence of God, the understanding of good and evil is the greatest proof for the existence of God because without God you could have no understanding of good or evil. There is no absolute Principle upon which morality and ethics can be rooted. This is what happens when revelation is removed form intellect. Intellect can be evil. In the golden mean, intellect is the mean between craftiness and stupidity. It can be used for evil. But religion without intellect can also be used for mass genocide as well. One would find a way to interpret religion to justify one's brutality, which is why bringing 'aql and naql together is so difficult but also so fundamentally important. 


* And yet our religion has been so brilliant in doing this, and the man who has done it at the end of the long road is thusly called ""The Proof of Islam"", and it is Imam al-Ghazali. He brought usul al-fiqh, he was one of the greatest usuli masters in history; he brought the dimension of 'Aqidah, he brought the philosophical traditions, and he brought the spiritual traditions, and he synthesized them all into this extraordinary exposition of Islam. He demonstrated how these are not all exclusive meanings, they are all different facets of the Truth."

religion,lj5q30,For Jews Christians and Muslims the plausible deep meaning of the star of David and the prophecy of the first word of the Torah/Tawrat,"Hello,

Those elements will be some kind of ""revelation"" for some of you and for the others it will seem like nonsense, but it will still be interesting facts. Some of you which will understand this will be shocked, but it is normal because those who discovered this were shocked too.  If you find this to be nonsense it is your choice everyone is free to believe in what he thinks is right to believe in.

The star of David is known as the Solomon Seal  or the Khatam Suleiman. We will examine its deep meaning and we will then see the first word of the Torah/Tawrat.

Those successive explainations won't make any sense if you don't understand the first world of the Torah/Tawrat. This word is the **uncorruptible word**. Which means even if the Torah/Tawrat was modified or even falsified the first word was impossible to modify because it is the word everyone knew. Because everyone knew the first word of the Torah/Tawrat it was impossible to alter it. If you want to understand it you have to read until the end.

It is a symbol which was believed to be used in early judaism. Archeologists found an hexagram from the arch of a 3rd–4th century synagogue in Galilee. Then this symbol was used by Christians and Muslims too. We can say it is probable that the Creator wanted us to know this symbol because we all used it. So it is probable that this symbol has a deep meaning for us to understand and to discover.

Jews and Christians are aware of this use of symbol but many muslims don't even know this is one of their symbols and they associate it with judaism. here are some examples of Islam using this symbol :

examples at the al-Aqsa mosque :

*Processing img z0ohdawxe9h61...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img rly1jpize9h61...*

So the star of David is a symbol which is made of 2 equilateral triangles.

&amp;#x200B;

If you connect the edges of the star of david you get an Hexagon like in this pendant :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mna7kjrkg9h61.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d815b999b0e724bdab3d3e00f7582bd19ba6e6d4

But can we go deeper to understand more mysteries ? to understand our Creator's secret one has to be humble and able to open his hearth and get ride of his own human pride.

https://preview.redd.it/tsqu91xli9h61.jpg?width=236&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68edca76d11673dae76ec4bc53f84aa04b4ece5b

Here is a simple hexagon, now let's add **THREE** lines inside it :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r88ev7nqi9h61.jpg?width=236&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3afdd7c2c8eedd0a9c7f26726ab0bdb0389985d4

We end up with a cube. Muslims know this too well. They call it the Kaaba or the house of God. But we haven't finished yet. What happens if you open the house of God to UNFOLD the mysteries ?

There are 11 ways to unfold a cube let's take a look at those :

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fyq7cxo2p9h61.gif

There are Four of those who look like a serpent. In the Torah there are **THREE** important episodes where there are snakes. First of all when the serpent asks EVE to eat the apple. Then when Moses/Musa uses the serpent of the Creator to eat the serpents of the egyptian priests of pharaoh. The last one which is very interesting is when jews are complaining their living conditions in the desert to the Creator. Then to punish them he sends flying serpents to bite the Jews. Then He asks Moses to make a bronze serpent :

&amp;#x200B;

**"" Make a fiery** ***serpent*****, and put it on a flag** ***pole*****; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, and looks at it, will live.” So Moses made a bronze serpent and put it on the flag** ***pole*****; ""**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jko8ucdjm9h61.jpg?width=201&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=930dc917a9823df3b467e20c9f22335410f1edeb

This is what ancient usual flag poles looked like (this one is a roman version of it). Interestingly there is another way to **unfold a cube** which is the TAV way or the Tau way which looks like those poles :

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g1eu154jn9h61.gif

We can supposedly say looking at ancient flag poles that the the Brazen Serpent was put on a Tav T shaped pole :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c6oz9pjyp9h61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57542d5eb36466ed0d7d294230e7351769eb4e0

Now let's take a look at The First Word of the Torah/Tawrat which is **Beresheet**. Because everyone knew in the past knew that the First word of the Torah/Tawrat was Beresheet **NO ONE** would even try to modify it - **It was impossible to change this word** because it MEANT  **In the beginning** this is an **Uncorruptible** word and because of that, it means that it is an **extremely important Word.** Everyone knows the first word of a prayer if someones tries to force and modify the prayer he will never be able to change the first word no one can do it is even more true with the first word of a Holy Book. The first word of the bible is the ONLY ONE which was impossible to change.

Let's take a look at how ancient Jew wrote **Beresheet** before their babylonian captivity :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lacg65bor9h61.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591dbd5387ee4bea6d803532d164563836857653

The Ancient Hebrew alphabet was made of symbols/pictorams which could represent a sound/letter but they also had their own meaning (words and ideas) like Aleph was the sound/letter A but meant Powerfull or infinite. Ancient Hebrew is red from right to left.

let's take a look at Beyt :

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uylt6zaht9h61.gif

**BEYT** means the floor plan of a  **TENT or a HOUSE**

the second letter is **Reysh** :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7y4pc3z1x9h61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3f6deb556066828179d71760ec084076d8302b7

**REYSH** Means HEAD or PRINCE. Beyt + REYSH = BAR which means Son.

You have Tent and Prince but you have also Son

The third letter is **Aleph** : 

https://preview.redd.it/u5e8t9h0y9h61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bd94b19404d462f24ed35100c5b7ad2952733e9

Aleph Means Strong Leader or OX. It is also the first letter of the alphabet. Elohim/Ilahi-Ilah (in aramaic) which was one of the Name of the Creator. Its written name began with an Aleph.

The three precedent letters BETH RESH AND ALEPH together mean created or creator.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oes66466z9h61.png?width=1273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9430263ac249061bd57b855d492a75a09b7ae94

So in beresheet you have the words : Tent, Prince and Son, Strong Leader, creator.

Next we have the letter **Sheen** :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nl31mjoz9h61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b76ad4a7b4613284444872eb85d61731c49b14e0

**Sheen** means Teeth, Press down, Crush and destroy.

The three precedent letters are Resh Aleph Sheen together they mean REYSH which signifies prince

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4kpvg09q0ah61...*

So you have the words : Tent, Prince, Son, Strong leader, Creator, Destroy, prince

Next you have **Yood** :

*Processing img ildnwk802ah61...*

**Yood** means arm or hand but it could mean the creator too as his Name was known to begin with a Yood. 

So you have the words : Tent, Prince, Son, Strong leader, Creator, Destroy, prince, Hand, Creator,

The last Letter is **TAV**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 62xo1t4z2ah61...*

**Tav** which was represented by a symbolisation of a cross.

So you have the words : Tent, Prince, Son, Strong leader / Creator, Destroyed, prince, Hand/Creator, Cross.

The Creator was Known as the Alpha and the Omega which means he is the beginning and the End which means he ends everything since the beginning. Beresheet is the word for the beginning and the END :

So you have the words : 

**The Prince of the Tent/House, Son of the Strong Leader our Creator is Destroyed by the Hand of the creator on the Cross.**  

Here is the full explaination of this prophecy if you want to listen to : 

[https://youtu.be/PtATSQx3cjI?t=2](https://youtu.be/PtATSQx3cjI?t=2)

**To end this one of the last ways to unfold the house of the Creator (the cube) / Kaaba is the cross way** :

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img n3irvut04ah61...*

So what is inside the House of the Creator ? When you unfold it you have 3 Elements : **the serpent of the Creaor** which ate the pharao's serpent, **the brazen serpent** and finally **the Cross**. 

What does it mean ? 

Possible interpretation :

Our Great and Prestigious Creator told the Jews which are his Chosen people (and will stay forever) if you want to be healed look at the brazen serpent which is put on the TAV flag pole and you will be cured. Jews will stay his chosen people for ever. Why ? it is simple the Creator keeps his promises we humans don't keep them but he will always keep them. Moreover The creator is Past Present and future he already knew what was going to happen when he chose the Jews as his chosen People. The cure of the bronze serpent set on a pole was for the fying serpents poison. But what was the real serpent's poison ? Our death which was caused by Eve eating the forbidden fruit. It could have a second meaning : If you look at the One which will be destroyed on the TAV you will be cured of the serpent's poison which corrupted Adam and Eve : DEATH. 

You are not forced to believe in those elements, the choice is always yours. If you are Jew or Muslim you will certainly look at this with skepticism however i want you to take a look at 2 events which took place in our modern World which never hapenned in the Hebrew and Muslim world. Those are the biggest miracles in our modern world which are the Marian apparitions of El-Zeitoun and Fatima. 

Fatima is a weird place in Portugal. It began with a love story between a Portuguese Knight and a Muslim princess in the medieval times. The portuguese  Gonçalo Hermingues was in love with the daughter of a renown Emir called Fatima. Gonçalo kidnapped the princess and the portuguese king allowed their mariage only if fatima would convert to christianism. After her mariage the king gave them lands in Portugal one of them which is still called fatima. In 1917 the Virgin Maryah/Maryam appeared in front of 3 kids. Those kids told people but no one belived in them. So the virgin promised them to do a miracle to prove that it was real. The kids told the people a Date for a future miracle. Skeptics, Freemasons, Scholars, Engineers and even the police came to the event. It gathered between 40'000 to 70'000 people. They saw a glowing orb and many were curred from serious ilnesses. This is one of the reasons many scholars are still believers in Portugal. [https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRSJQmhcOx84zH40v1V7woU-ghXUj53WOmh2A&amp;usqp=CAU](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRSJQmhcOx84zH40v1V7woU-ghXUj53WOmh2A&amp;usqp=CAU)

Lucia which was one of the three kids which were communicating with the virgin also predicted the death of Pope John Paul I. Lucia told to him for you the Days of Christ which was known to have died after being 30 or 33 years old. John Paul I died after 33 days of being Pope. 

Maryah or Maryam which is the name of the Holy Mother of Yeshua/Isa appeared in El-Zeitoun in 1968.  A Muslim named Farouk Mohammed Atwa saw her on the roof of church and thought it was someone comitting suicide she appeared in front of Thousands of Muslims and Christians  at St. Mary's Coptic Church . She knelt in front of cross and came multiple times. Many egyptians still remember those events. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our\_Lady\_of\_Zeitoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Zeitoun)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skkd7DCNSWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skkd7DCNSWc)

Yeshua Spoke Aramaic what is interesting is that Maryah in Aramaic meant Master YAH. Perhaps a sign that Mary was a direct creation of the Creator. 

**One of the probable proofs that this isn't myths but reality is that :**

The prophecy of St-John/Yohanan had vision in which the city of god would come from the sky describes it like that : 

The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:9-21#fen-NIV-31070a)\] in length, and as wide and high as it is long. **17** The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:9-21#fen-NIV-31071b)\] thick. 

the city is like a cube/kaaba which would unfold in the shape of a cross. So you will ask me where is the proof ?

We all know that in the commandements recieved by Moses that the creator supposedly stopped to word on the 7th day which is according to jewish tradition **SATURDAY.** Saturday is the day of the planet SATURN. If you look at Saturn there is a Hexagon shaped storm on the pole and scientist can't explain it they tried but they failed at it. As we know hexagon are a symbol the cube. So it may possible that the Creator is creating this city right now on the planet saturn :

Well i hope it will perhaps offer you a new view on christianity. One belives in what he choses to be right. You don't need to agree with all of this."
religion,lj55p9,Crazytalk. (Are there any experienced people here? Am I the only one?),"I lucid dream a fair bit. There is a whole other reality there. Overlaid by a shimmer of hallucination perhaps, but hey what isn't?

Intense concentration meditation can lead to the powers of future-seeing and wishing.

There is an afterlife. An underground city. Eternal night lit by beautiful lanterns. Party and music all the time. Dull people talking about their former lives. The occasional demon, limbs pointing all crazy. It's chill. It's actually very friendly and nice.

There is a creator-god. A million-faceted jewel-star that emits the world. The world starts as poetry energy and then congeals into clouds of dreaming. And by dreaming I mean this thing that we're experiencing here.

God is not conscious as far as I can tell. More of a volcano.

The poetry of reality is an emotion thing. And the emotions have an effect that works both ways in time. In other words, time is an artifact of the story overlaid the poetry-emotion-energy.

There are spirits around us 24-7. They talk like grandmothers, concerned for my well-being. I guess a lot of them are grandmothers."

religion,lj3so2,I am tired and angry and mentally sick!,"I may have made a promise to Gods not to ever bother myself with a certain ocd compulsion. I cant remember if they were semi-controlled, intrusive thoughts or not. I may have made the promise to force myself stop worrying about a certain ocd compulsion. I remember walking away from the compulsion and looking back at it and worrying that maybe I broke it just, because I turned around to look at it. I think, I got worried and I said that the promise would count after I leave that area. I think, since then, turning around/back to look/check something was written as something bad in my subconscious.

All that was 2.5 years ago. Today, I was in my bed and was trying to remember if I made such a promise. The ""must not turn around"" was in my head. Suddenly, I got a thought like ""I must becareful not to do any movements because if I turn around while thinking about my problem,it may count as imitation of that day and maybe that will break the promise"". Suddenly, I got an itch in my left ear and as a reflex my body turned to the left and i started scracthing it a little.

I worry because of how my body turned to my left. it was as if maybe my body for a second, subconsciously, turned around just because I was thinking ""must not turn around because it may count as an imitation"" I worry that maybe I subconsciously, imitated something that I did that day (2,5 years ago) and maybe that broke the promise. I cant remember if the promise were intrusive thoughts or a real prayer. I remember being anxious about it that night. AND NOW I AM ANGRY WITHH MY SELF AND MY LIFE!

i am fucking tired and angry. I AM ANGRY! now, I must worry that I may have accidentally, broken that promise just because I may have subconsciously, imitated something that I may have done that night?

I cant remember the promise. Maybe I may have said that I will never bother myself with that compulsion. Does my imitation count as bothering myself with that compulsion? does thinking about it counts as bothering myself with it? Does that mean that I broke the promise?

WHY I CANT FUCKING REMEMBER THE PROMISE? I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A PROMISE BUT I CANT REMEMBER IT! WAS IT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS OR A REAL PRAYER?

I AM FUCKING TIRED. ITS NOT MY FAULT THAT MY OCD FOUND A WAY TO REPLACE ITS COMPULSIONS WITH PROMISES. I WORRY BECAUSE I MAY HAVE ASKED FOR A SPECIFIC BAD PUNISHMENT. I DO NOT WANT THAT PUNISHMENT. ITS NOT MY FAULT THAT MY OCD WAS USING SOMETHING THAT I FEAR TO REPLACE THE COMPULSIONS!"

religion,lixjhk,Reincarnation or Rebirth,"Belief in rebirth or reincarnation is common to both religions. Both agree that rebirth is an unintended consequence of engaging in desire-ridden actions, and becoming involved with the world and its objects and pleasures. Both affirm that beings are born repeatedly until they achieve liberation. Although humans have some control over where, when and how they can take birth, it is not true that humans are always reborn as humans, and animals as animals. It is determined by karma. Humans may be born as animals, and vice versa according to their deeds. Some may even languish in the afterworlds such as the world of ghosts for their cardinal sins (suicide, etc.). . In other words, immediate rebirth is not guaranteed for all. Upon death, beings may go to different heavens or hells according to their karma, where they stay in subtle states until they return to earth to take another birth. How long they stay there, this is also determined by their past actions only. However, while Hinduism believes that the eternal Self (Atman) participates in rebirth or transmigration, Buddhism holds that it is the not-self or the impermanent self which goes through numerous births and deaths until it is completely dissolved."

religion,liwgl8,God answered a prayer. Is this a good sign?,"God answered a prayer. Is this a good sign?

Hi there! 

I’m 27F and I received some amazing news today: A meeting with a suitor. (Btw does this count as a date?)

We will call him Alex.

His parents are long time family friends (they are close friends with my dad’s older brother and his wife). Since before I was born.

Since I was 14, I’ve had a crush on him (we have never actually spoken, but we have seen each other). As I got older, his mom was always so nice to me. A lot friendlier than I expected (especially when I got in my late teens and early 20s). 

Almost 3 years ago, my parents happened to attend a dinner party. So my mom and the guy’s mom got into a conversation. His mom told my mom that they have had me in mind for their son all this time. They had gone looking at other girls who would potentially suitable for their son, but they always came back to me in the end. His mom said that every time she sees me, she thinks of her son. She really thinks we would be perfect for each other. 

I was shocked and it was the kindest thing anyone has ever said. 

For a little while, things were on a pause (I think they were waiting on me to finish school). I received a marriage proposal from another family earlier this week. My aunt is really close friends with Alex’s mom and must have told her that I received a potential marriage proposal from another family. 

Later this morning, Alex’s mom called my mom and said that Alex wants to meet me. Apparently he and his parents had a long conversation about this. So my mom surprised me with this news and I was overjoyed. 

Alex is 31 years old. He is coming on his own to my house so he can meet me. I’m so excited but also incredibly nervous. 

Should I take this as a good sign that he’s coming to meet me on his own? It feels so surreal. I’ve been wanting to actually meet him for years and it’s finally happening. I’ve never been on a date before so I don’t know at all what to expect. I’m also very boy shy,"
religion,liwf24,"The story of Adam, eve and satan [islamic story]","1. Surely We created you, then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblis, who refused to prostrate with the others. \[*Satan chose to be satan by disobeying Allah\]* 
2. Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?”  He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him  from clay.” \[*First racist, he is applying his logic rather acknowledging Allah is the all knowing the wise*\]. 
3. Allah said, “Then get down from Paradise! It is not for you to be  arrogant here. So get out! You are truly one of the disgraced.” 
4. He appealed, “Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.”\[*he didn't repent, Allah would accept his repentance*\]. 
5. Allah said, “You are delayed ˹until the appointed Day˺.”\[*As he accepted this prayer*\]. 
6. He said, “For leaving me to stray I will lie in ambush for them on Your Straight Path.I will approach them from their front, their back, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.” \[*he is so arrogant, he declared he will mislead all human\]*
7. Allah said, “Get out of Paradise! You are disgraced and rejected! I will  certainly fill up Hell with you and your followers all together.” \[*he is not the ruler of hell, who ever will follow Satan will be in hell with him\]*
8. ˹Allah said,˺ “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from  wherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be  wrongdoers.” \[*the tree is not that important as there is no mention of what tree was that, the important thing is Allah's command\]*
9. Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was hidden of their  nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to  prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.” \[*Maybe the first lie Adam and eve heard. Quran doesn't blame eve. here you can see the word ""Them""\]*
10. And he swore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.” \[*first lie didn't work, Satan then swear by god\]*
11. So he brought about their fall through deception. And when they tasted  of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to  cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. Then their Lord called out  to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you  that Satan is your sworn enemy?”\[*Adam and eve disobey the command of Allah, same as satan did.\]*
12. They replied, “Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers.” \[*That is the difference. human is not arrogant in nature, they repent to their lord*\]
13. Allah said, “Descend as enemies to each other. You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.” He added, “There you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be resurrected.”
14. O children of Adam! We have provided for you clothing to cover your  nakedness and as an adornment. However, the best clothing is  righteousness. This is one of Allah’s bounties, so perhaps you will be  mindful.
15. O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your  parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to  expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where  you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who  disbelieve.

There is something important to do with nakedness. Maybe after that incident human first learn about the knowledge of sex, children and  a life of earth. \[purely my opinion\]

religion,liuzjm,Does anyone else see religion as purely functional?,"Hi everyone! 

So I have come to the conclusion that religion was created for functional purposes only. This does not mean the whole “religion is just to control you!!!” line. 

For me, religion is about being the best person you can be and there are different ways to do that and earn “points” to get into a better place after death. To me heaven does not really exist or matter, it’s just the incentive. Same with god. If there is a god and heaven then great!! If not than the religion has taught you to be a better person. Some people don’t need religion to make them good (and no I don’t mean most of the atheist bros that come on here to harass people). 
I guess a big question I have is, why do you need to worship god to go to heaven? Can’t you just be a good person and that’s enough? It seems like god is really egotistical to me to need praise?

The reason why things you are meant to do for religion is for your own health and safety in my mind, it’s not for a god. If the Quran or Hadith asks you to do Wudu before prayer, it’s for your own health, because in ancient times it was important to be clean so as not to get sick. 
The reason to pray in all religions is to be mindful because it can make you more productive can feel better about yourself. 

So after all this thought, I wish there could be a new religion that could actually be updated to help people be the healthiest and best they could be in modern times. Like instead of praying, you spend 10 minutes without your phone 6 times a day. 

This is just my random thoughts but I’d be very interested to hear what you all think! Have a great day or night everyone :))!"

I have visited ( via Zoom ) a liberal masjid (al Rabia) and felt a sense of peace and ""rightness"" . I have been reading the Quran as well and it feels more ""right "" than what I've read of the Bible (I was raised a Christian) . I also like the idea of the hijab ( not as a tool of oppression or something that is forced, but as a personal choice and an identity thing ). I have considered converting but heres the problem:

A: I don't know that I believe the Quran is the literal word of God as opposed to an inspired text or that Mohammed was infallible , as some of the Quran and hadiths don't work when taken literally due to today's scientific and social knowledge.
B: I see good things in other religions . For example, I like the sense of tradition married to modern ethics of Reform Judaism ( and the holidays are beautiful ) and I think Jesus and Buddha, among others had wise words to take into consideration , whether or not they were inspired or just visionary thinkers. 
My question is, is being a generally spiritual person that draws life advice from multiple faiths wrong, if I'm not actually claiming to be a part of exclusive groups like the Jewish community ? I'm aware Unitarian Universalists kinda do this ( and I like that they're LGBT friendly, to boot  ) but I'm worried about offending people or somehow ""stealing"" their beliefs."

religion,ligfg9,Many professing Christians will be left out of heaven.,"There will be many people from different cultures and religions in heaven. Jesus said in John 10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd. Also, Matthew chapter 25 goes into great detail about people going to heaven that did not even know Jesus. 

Romans chapter 2 talks about people not knowing God or Jesus but living the teaching of Jesus without knowing what He said. 

Jesus also said in Matthew 7:21 “Not every one that saith unto Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the will of My Father who is in Heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that Day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name have cast out devils, and in Thy name done many wonderful works?’ 23 And then will I profess unto them, ‘**I never knew you: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.’  &lt;-----** wow, He did not say depart from me you who did not believe in me. He said: depart from me you who practice lawlessness. Just because you say you are a Christian doesn't mean you are one. 

A Christians is a person who obeys His teachings. (Luke 6:46 “And why call ye Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not the things which I say?)

 Listen to [Bill Maher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlZZv1OsgFA) tell you that you are not a Christian because you are not following Jesus's teachings. It's funny and true at the same time.

The Orthodox population in Israel are disproportionally represented in infection rates compared to the general population, because they keep resisting COVID safety measures.

God allows suffering because Satan, Adam and Eve disobeyed God and rebelled. Essentially by their actions, saying they didn't need God. God is proving them wrong by giving humans time to rule ourselves under the guidance of Satan. 

Satan essentially challenged God as a ruler so God is giving him the opportunity to guide humanity in Gods place. 

Remember that there are angles in heaven who are also aware of whats happening. God could have destroyed all of them but that wouldn't have answered the question would it? Is Satan a better God than God? 

The Bible tells us that “the whole world is lying in the power of the evil one.” (1 John 5:19) The god of this world, Satan, is evil and deceptive. He is “deceiving the whole earth.” (Revelation 12:9)"

religion,li7h8x,Anitya,"Belief in the impermanence of the world is a common to both religions, which they recognize as a major source of suffering and the reason to practice Dharma and achieve liberation. Both agree that the world is in a state of flux and unstable, just as the mind and body are. Death, decay, aging, sickness and suffering are unavoidable problems of life. No one can escape from them. All objects in the objective realm are subject to decay and destruction. The impermanence of things becomes a problem when we become attached to them or form a relationship with them. Caught in between attraction and aversion to things, we experience gain and loss, and various conflicting states, emotions and feelings which constitute suffering. Hence, in both religions, you will find a great emphasis upon cultivating equanimity, sameness, detachment, renunciation, etc., to bring the mind to complete rest. However, as stated before, Buddhists believe that nothing in existence is permanent, while Hindus hold that the Self (Isvara) is eternal, constant and indestructible. Hence, one can escape from impermanence into permanence and immortality by knowing oneself and attaining liberation."

I grew up in a Jehovah's Witness household. My parents were exemplary members of their congregation until they divorced when I was about 7-8 years old. Following this I was to live with my mother until I was 18, in a household that was not religious and through my mother's views we held great disdain for religion especially for the Jehovah's witness community. She convinced us that they were evil(though she would later join the faith once more) and that religion was a waste of time. However, I always felt a connection to ""God"" and to the views of the Jehovah's witnesses probably partly because my father remained in the faith and I wanted to seek his approval and a connection with him and those we left behind when we left the congregation, but mostly because it was something that was instilled in me when I was young. 

Fast forward to the present, I am a 30-something year-old struggling with finding any spiritual or religious meaning in my life. I wouldn't say I'm unhappy or desperate, but I have been curious as to what my religious standing is and how I view the concept of God and faith. I don't agree with all the teachings that come with being a Jehovah's witness, although I don't have a bad word to say about any of the people I have met both in my original congregation or those I have met more recently. I fully believe they are pure of heart in their beliefs but I have a hard time adhering to all their teachings. 

The way I currently practice faith and/or religion is through prayer every night(praying to Jehovah, the only deity I was taught to approach) and I ask for guidance / forgiveness. However, I have always felt a disconnection there, and prayer is just a way to try to find or keep a connection into faith for me. I don't go to church, or attend any Jehovah's witness meetings, or anything else of the sort. I want to believe in a deity of some sort, however it has become more and more difficult as I grow older. Regardless, I pray every night - out of habit if nothing else.

I have done some introspection into my spirituality recently and that is partly why I am writing this today. I don't believe myself to be very religious. However, I do believe in 'something' above/after this existence after I move on. I also believe in karma to some extent, and the Buddhist philosophies, views on karma, mediation, etc., and they are what have most keenly drawn my attention lately. The Ying and Yang concept has also always been a part of my thought process. I just don't know where I stand in terms of religion. I would like to believe in some deity that would understand my existence and appreciate my suffering and attempts at betterment, however I have a hard time conceptualizing that. 

To entertain my curiosity I used a few ""find you religion"" websites and they found me to be 'solidly secular' or atheist. I don't really want to accept these however. As I believe I am more religious than these labels appreciate. 

I pray daily, I practice a life that appreciates karma and the suffering of others. I try to be pure in my intensions and actions, and I want to leave this world knowing I didn't leave a 'net-suffering' through my actions as I exit, if that makes sense. That is to say I hope that my actions leave the world a slightly better place, as minor as it may be, as I leave this existence. I am not a huge fan of group gatherings for religion, or group prayer, but I am also not against it. I have recently started to meditate - trying various concepts for this such as the Jesus prayer and other more traditional ways of meditation. I also have difficulties believing that the Bible or other words of scripture are direct guidance from God, but I do believe they serve a purpose, regardless of their origin.

TLDR: I am not sure which religious 'sect' I fit into but I would like to find some guidance or advice into what I should study next to find my true spiritual meaning. Any advice or guidance would be appreciated."

religion,lhtg1u,"Sympathy for Christian conservatives who feel society slipping away from them, yet I do not agree with them or their means.","First things first. I am not a Christian conservative. I do lean towards some form of Christianity most of the time but it is a constant struggle to maintain my faith in it. Sometimes I find things within Christianity downright repugnant like infinite torture for a finite sin. Other times it is things that simply don't align with my view of reality, like dinosaurs existing 6000 years ago alongside Adam and Eve. I am a semi-trained scientist, I at least understand the scientific method in principle and why it works. 

I have mostly (almost entirely) secular and liberal friends and family. I worry about Christianity being right and me somehow being accepted by God (by the skin of my teeth I'm sure) only to lose everyone I've ever loved because they were not believers. Worse still to watch them tormented for eternity. 

I also have a hard time sharing my views with people I am closest to for this reason. Some examples; I don't believe abortion should be an option in all cases. I think for rapes/incest/ectopic pregnancy/other things like that it is fine and important. I also have no problems with contraceptives, unlike some churches. I believe in comprehensive sex education. However, I don't believe in getting abortions simply because a person was lax with contraceptives and doesn't want to take responsibility for what they created. I think laziness and irresponsibility is a bad reason to abort a child, I'm unsure and even doubtful a criminal penalty would do any good however. I believe life is a miracle, not for any supernatural reason, but just relative to the vast emptiness and coldness of space and the cosmos around us. Life certainly seems to be the exception to the rule and it should be revered.

Now onto my main point: I see often that many Christian conservatives feel there is a distinct decline in morality and impending collapse of society due to immoral decadence. I am not 100% on board with this idea, but I see why they feel that way and empathize with them. 

The main area where I disagree is using politics as a means to address this decline. I don't think it has good consequences. An example of a bad consequence is a conservative politician promising to do something about abortion, which brings in a lot of single-issue Christian voters, but in every other way they are pure malignant evil. I also don't think anyone could find any biblical support for using politics as a means to change society to be more Christian. The end times in the book of Revelation does not say, ""Republicans then voted the beast out of office in a democratic election and lived happily ever after"" nor does it say ""a courageous group of Christian men loaded up their AR-15's and conquered the antichrist and his followers"".

It's also a bit fuzzy with me where the line is drawn between something that leads to the moral decline of society, and something that is merely a person's liberty being expanded upon. This is especially relevant as a trans-woman who may be seen as both a symptom of moral decline by some and an expression of personal liberty by others. 

I feel with all the recent Qanon things people are losing their minds to ""end times fear"". People think masks have something to do with the mark of the beast because they aren't allowed to do commerce in stores without them. People think their political enemies are literally feasting on the blood of children. I saw a video of a woman who was basically praying to Trump to save her from the devil. It's insanity to me. I would NEVER idolize a politician that way. I think that this idolization is more indicative of something resembling revelations end times prophecy than mask wearing.  


In the recent election, in my country, I did not vote for Trump, I did not vote for Joe Biden either. I think people idolized a very bad narcissistic person in their insane love of Donald Trump. He even said he was ""the chosen one"" on national TV in between ridiculing disabled people and making excuses for neo-nazis. 

The reason I did not vote for Joe Biden is that I felt like at best we could expect 4 years of palliative care that does nothing to solve the massive levels of sickness in our society and worse just makes us more comfortable and complacent with the decline. Maybe he will prove me wrong.   


Aside from the idolization of Trump, which I will never understand, I do empathize with some of the albeit unfounded, fears and paranoias of the Christian right. Though, it would be wrong not to address the Bible itself as promoting fears and paranoias of this kind, especially in the last book.

 I do feel at times that evil is running rampant in our society. It seems mostly caused by ignorance and inequality at first glance, but there are things that trouble me deeply. Namely, pornography. This is a very personal and difficult to talk about issue with me. I was addicted to pornography at a very young and vulnerable age because I found a stash of magazines and I've struggled with it for 30 years to this day.  
However, the thing that troubles me the most is that temporally my puberty lined up exactly with the widespread availability of high speed internet. It seems, in my sometimes conspiratorial mind, as if an evil, like Satan perhaps, arranged for this timing maliciously. I feel my generation was exposed to the biggest temptation towards pornography of any generation in history at the exact age when we were most vulnerable. In that way I sort of feel targeted and attacked.  


Lastly, I feel like I see Satanism, Neo-paganism and ""wicca"" or witchcraft, everywhere now. It's ubiquitous and although these people do little to offend or harm me directly and I am tolerant towards them and avoid proselytizing my Christianity to them, I still feel like I understand where Christian conservatives are coming from when they perceive a ""moral decline"" in society when they see satanists and witches everywhere they look. Then again, the anti-Christ and beast of revelation do not come under any of these banners, but instead as a counterfeit Christianity. Christians should absolutely be mindful of this. The very labels of Christian and Christianity will be used against them and will be the disguise of the end-times enemy they profess to believe in. The deceiver, in other words, comes from within.   


So all that said, in conclusion, I don't feel conservative Christians are 100% correct about the decline of morality in society. I think more care could be given to distinguish between healthy expansions of liberty and moral declines. I think technology has changed everything and humanity has not caught up with the speed of change and that in itself is frightening. I do empathize with people who think and fear this way, but I am not wholly convinced. Christians have always seemed to feel as if they were the generation in the end times and I think we have to be aware of that, yet one of these days, though no man knows which, it will be true."

religion,lhkrdq,"Lucifer is not the name of the Devil, his actual name is never mentioned in the Bible.","Isaiah 14:3,4
""When the Lord has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve, 4 **you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon**:""

The only verse which contains ""lucifer""

Isaiah 14:12
""How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!""

This passage is not in reference to a fallen angle but an earthly king (the king of Babylon). 

The word “lucifer” in the Vulgate is not a proper name.  It is simply a translation from the Hebrew word “heylel” (or “halal” or “helel”), found in the Hebrew Masoretic text.

In the Book of Isaiah, chapter 14, the king of Babylon is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet Isaiah and is called הֵילֵל בֶּן-שָׁחַר (Helel ben Shachar, Hebrew for ""shining one, son of the morning""). The title ""Helel ben Shahar"" refers to the planet Venus as the morning star, and that is how the Hebrew word is usually interpreted. The The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as Ἑωσφόρος (heōsphoros), ""bringer of dawn"", the Ancient Greek name for the morning star. Similarly the Vulgate renders הֵילֵל in Latin as Lucifer, the name in that language for the morning star. The English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, ""Lucifer""

The Bible translators translated the Hebrew word הֵילֵ֣ל or ""helel"" as “lucifer.” Helel comes from a root meaning “shining one.” However, Lucifer isn’t an English translation of the Hebrew word helel. It’s a Latin translation of the word. The KJV translators borrowed the word Lucifer from the Vulgate, the Latin translation of the Bible. In Latin Lucifer has the sense of “light-bearing” and “morning star.” Rather than translate the Hebrew word helel as “shining one” or “morning star” like modern translations do, the KJV translators inserted the Latin term “lucifer” and capitalized it in this verse. Since people thought this passage was referring to Satan, Lucifer became synonymous with Satan’s name.

Greek: ὁ ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωὶ ἀνατέλλων | ho heōsphoros ho prōi anatellōn
trans.: the Day Star, which used to rise early in the morning

Latin
lucifer qui mane oriebaris
trans: O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning

The Devil's name is never mentioned in the Bible. Even in the book of Job, where our English translations call him Satan, that isn’t what we find in Hebrew. Satan is a translation of the Hebrew word “satan” which means adversary. In Job the word “satan” has “the” in front of it. It would be more accurate to translate each occurrence in Job as “the adversary.”

Names are important to God, a person’s name reflects their character. We see this when God changed the names of Abram to Abraham Genesis 17:4-6 and Jacob to Israel Genesis 32:29. To know someone's personal names makes it possible to cultivate a relationship with them, the Bible tell us to oppose the devil. God does not want us getting to know Satan the Devil. It stands to reason he wouldn't give us the personal name of a powerful spirit creature who is our proclaimed enemy, according to the Bible."
religion,lhki9f,"God answered a prayer, but, why do I not feel happy/excited?","God answered a prayer, but, why do I not feel happy/excited?

I’m 27F and I received some news today. I’ve never been in a relationship before, or ever been asked out on a date. I definitely would describe myself to be a romantic. I’ve always wondered what it would be like to be in a relationship. 

My mom told me about a marriage proposal (I know, it’s an old-fashioned way of doing things) set up by one of my dad’s close friends. This family my dad’s friend knows has a son who is apparently really nice. He has a stable career and the family is super down to earth. My dad’s friend insisted that we give this guy a chance. Earlier this evening, I found out that my parents are going to meet this guy’s parents in a couple weeks. (And if the meeting goes well, both my parents and his parents will exchange our numbers)

It’s not an arranged marriage. They just want us to meet each other and see if we click.

I’ve been feeling a mix of emotions: Anxiety, nervousness, uncertainty, and sadness (mainly about leaving my parents. I really am dreading that). I actually went up to my room and cried (they were not tears of joy) Is this normal? Why do I feel this way? The excitement I felt was very slight. It’s crazy because I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, meeting a guy, courting him, and eventually marrying him. Didn’t expect these emotions to come up. I still feel this way.

It doesn’t make sense because I’ve prayed about this for YEARS. I’ve suffered from loneliness. And I only began my walk with the Lord a few months ago. I was feeling relatively content getting to know Him (although with some lonely days here and there), then suddenly I received this news and I felt (and am still feeling) sad, anxious, and nervous.

Last night, I felt a bit more curious so I looked him up and then ended up feeling more disappointed. 

Why do I feel this way? Is it a bad thing that I don’t want to meet him?"

religion,lhh0ft,Karma,"Both religions believe in the doctrine of karma, according to which desire-ridden actions have consequences and bear fruit. It is the fruit of Karma, which moves the wheel of life and continuation of the worlds. Beings accumulate positive and negative karma according to their actions. Good actions produce good fruit of karma, and vice versa. Both have consequences and lead to bondage, suffering, death and rebirth. According to Hinduism, karma is unavoidable, but can be resolved through desireless and selfless actions, transformative and purificatory yogas and the grace of God or a personal deity. Buddhists believe that one can overcome karma by practicing the Dhamma on the Eightfold Path as taught by the Buddha, renouncing all desires and attachments, and purifying and controlling the mind and body. Some Buddhist sects do believe that worshipping the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and other divine beings may have beneficent effect, since one may earn meritorious karma by doing so and partially neutralize their sinful past. However, both traditions believe that the best remedy to suffering is not engaging in good karma, but achieving liberation."

religion,lhb6i9,How do you deal with strangers preaching to you about their religion unsolicited?,"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point, but no promises.

Religious background: 
for most of my life I’ve identified as a non-theistic Satanist with no ties to any organization, recently I’ve been dabbling into paganism and exploring my own spirituality(excluding Abrahamic faiths, I have a grudge and I’m biased. But I mostly keep it to myself unless I’m engaged in debates online) 

Situation: 
I have been driving for Lyft for the past 2 months. I have just over 500 rides completed with a perfect 5 star rating. Due to covid regulations we have to wear masks while riding with passengers in the car. I purchased a mask from the company Black Craft Cult that has an image of the Sigil of Baphomet with words “Believe in yourself” on it. 

Twice in the past month I’ve had 2 separate riders initiate a conversation with me that led to them preaching to me, saying they were going to pray for me(which I find highly, highly offensive btw) and suggesting me to different preachers and resources so I can “find Jesus” 

Normally, in an online environment I have no problem coming up with retorts and debating my position, however when confronted in person I froze up, I knew what I wanted to say, but I held back at risk of them reporting me to Lyft or giving me a bad review. And while I’m confident my religious rights would ultimately prevail, I just haven’t gotten the nerve to push the subject. What ended up happening was I awkwardly and politely just noted their concerns and said thank you. Even tho on the inside I was literally boiling with rage at the arrogance of these people. One of which was legitimately surprised when I informed him that I am happily married but didn’t go to church on Sundays. I heard him gasp out loud in my back seat.

Some other relevant notes: 

I live in California(not the Bible Belt), I dress sort of goth/punk whatever that means these days(piercings, tattoos, black clothing, leather jackets, combat boots). Not wearing my mask isn’t an option and suggesting so would be just as offensive as asking a Christian not to wear a cross. My tattoos are also visible and include various satanic and pagan images including upside crosses and pentagrams. So even if I didn’t wear my mask, people could still identify me as a Satanist/Pagan 

Questions:

How would others in my situation have handled this differently? Should I have been more firm with my desire to not be proselytized to? Why should I have to hide my beliefs or censor myself when others are free to openly judge and question my beliefs with impunity? Or should I just keep doing what I have been doing and just politely let them preach to me?"

religion,lh6gqo,God is no Fool!!,"Imagine yourself as God. You've made the universe from nothing, and your special creation is people. They can feel joy and sorrow, confidence and fear, love and hate. Earth, and the life people experience on it are just the start of life as you know it. You have the capacity to give them that life... to make them live forever, without sickness or sorrow. You can fill them so full of happiness that their present bodies could not contain it all. You can give them super-powers like yourself.

But first you want to know that they appreciate who you are and what you've done for them.

Some of these humans have formed clubs, where they talk about you. They rave about how great you are and how much they love you. But it's clear from their lives that they don't mean a word of it. Each club is different, but they all make their own rules about how to tell true worshippers from false ones - stupid rules that your worst enemy could follow!

So how are you going to decide who to give your blessings to? It's really not hard at all. You just find what people love most, and you ask them to trade it for all that you have... no, for your promise that you'll give them all that you have: eternal life, eternal joy, eternal adventure. If they have faith to do that, you've found true believers.

But how do you convince them that this set of rules is really coming from you? Well, you go down there yourself, in a human body, and tell them the rules, practice them yourself, and demonstrate in as many ways as necessary that you really are God, including coming back to life after being killed.

You do such a convincing job of it that they end up measuring all time from when you were born on their planet. Each year the whole world celebrates your appearance on their planet. They build huge cathedrals and multi-national organisations to honour the God who became a human.

But still they refuse to follow the rules that you came to give them. Still they cling to their trivial possessions, their jobs, their families, their lives. And they do this while claiming to be entitled to the eternal life you promised to those who showed their faith in you by meeting your specifications.

So what do you do? Do you throw out the rules, let people call the shots, and bow to their selfish decrees? Or do you stick to the rules and demand that they live by faith in you alone if they want to share in all that you have?

Only a fool would be conned into backing down to these liars and cheats, and you're no fool, are you?

But of course you aren't really God; and when you think about it, if you're not getting serious about obeying the rules he has given, then maybe you are the fool!"
religion,lh415x,What do you think of Muhammad's (pbuh) encounter with Gabriel?,"""Gabriel the angel that Muhamamd was supposed to have met in the cave while meditating and who brought down the Qur'an for recitation. In the first encounter, Aisha related that when Muhammad did not recite, Gabriel caught him (forcefully) and pressed him so hard that he could not bear it any more, and this was repeated three times. Gabriel left Muhammad terribly shaken. Muhammad feared that something might have happened to him, returned and asked Khadija to cover him until his fear was gone. Muhammad thought that the spirit was a jinn. (Sahih Bukhari 1.3) He even contemplated commiting suicide by throwing himself down a mountain.

Muhammad (pbuh) &amp; Khadija's Thigh:-                        

       Ibn Ishaq recorded that when the spirit came to Muhammad another time, Khadija tested him: 

Isma`il b. Abu Hakim, a freedman of the family of al-Zubayr, told me on Khadija's authority that she said to the apostle of Allah, 'O son of my uncle, are you able to tell me about your visitant, when he comes to you?"" He replied that he could, and she asked him to tell her when he came.

       So when Gabriel came to him, as he was wont, the apostle said to Khadija, 'This is Gabriel who has just come to me.' `Get up, O son of my uncle,' she said,
`and sit by my left thigh.'
The apostle did so, and she said, `Can you see him?' `Yes,' he said. She said,
`Then turn around and sit on my right thigh.' He did so, and she said, `Can you see him?' When he said that he could she asked him to move and sit in her lap.
When he had done this she again asked if he could see him, and when he said yes, she disclosed her form and cast aside her veil while the apostle was sitting in her lap. Then she said, `Can you see him?' And he replied, `No.' She said, `O son of my uncle, rejoice and be of good heart, by Allah he is an angel and not a satan.
(Ibn Ishaq, The Life of Muhammad, tr. Guillaume, 1967, p. 107)

       Abed El Malak Bin Hisham wrote the biography of Mohammed and he mentions that when Mohammed was at the cave of Hira, outside of Mecca, he was alone, when a spirit came and squeezed him, and told him, ""Read."" He went to this wife scared. And he continued to be in doubt of what happened to him. And one day, his wife Khadijah said to him, ""Mohammed, let us put that on a test. When the spirit comes to you, tell me, and we will test if that spirit is really Gabriel the angel, or a bad spirit."" He said OK.        

       One day, he was sitting with her, and he said, ""Khadijah, the spirit came!"" She said, ""Come, and sit on my right side."" So, he sat on her right side. She said, ""Mohammed, do you see the spirit?"" He said, ""Yes."" She said, ""Then sit on my left side."" So, he switched and he sat on her left side. ""Do you see the spirit?""Khadijah asked. ""Yes,"" Mohammed answered. ""Then sit on my lap."" He sits on her lap. ""Do you still see the spirit?"" ""Yes,"" Mohammed answered. Then she uncovered herself to show some of her feminine parts of body. And then she said, ""Do you see the spirit?"" He said, ""No."" She said, ""That spirit is good because he doesn't want to see my feminine part. You are the prophet of Allah."" And by that he came to be convinced that that spirit who was talking to him was the angel Gabriel, and a good spirit, because when he saw his wife almost naked, he didn't stay to see.

This testing is very interesting and appeared to be a cultural/traditional method of testing spirits. In Chinese culture, however, demons and devils are the ones afraid of female nude appearances, the exact opposite of the test by Khadija."" (In which the good spirit, Gabriel ""was afraid"" or did not want to see Khadija naked)."

I'm trying to put together a calendar of relevant religious holidays for a work project. I'd like to be as inclusive and informed as possible. The website that I am looking through has quite a few holidays from Jewish, Muslim, and Christian faiths. Unfortunately I'm running into the problem of having too many holidays per month. I'd like to know what celebrated events from each faith is most important for each month. I know most Christian Holidays, but would like to know if there are any others that are particularly important. As for the Jewish and Muslim faiths, I'm pretty lost. I'd like to list one or two of each per month, I'm also including a few other non-religious holidays so I can't have too many. If there are any other faiths that I could incorporate, I'd be happy to do so.

1. Many prophet came before, Prophet Muhammad was another prophet
2. He claimed to be prophet of **One** God.
3. He claimed to received Book from God.
4. He didn't deny any previous prophet but said they were on true path. (To me It seems he is a true lover of previous prophet and defend them. If any muslim claims that Moses or jesus was wrong on their teaching will be out of Islam)
5. He talked about all the teachings in detail. And God says in Quran(5:3) ""....This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion."" Any question you have about your life has answer in Islam from scripture. Fundamental teaching is crystal clear and not vague.
6. Only Prophet Muhammad said he is the last and final messenger.
7. As a final messenger he talked about sign of judgment day and afterlife in detail. because there will be no more prophet but judgement day. no more revelation from god about unseen. 

If I were jew or christian (my opinion out of ignorance) I were seriously think that it is the last messenger and prophet Muhammad was the logical end of prophet hood. All things seem common to your knowledge(one God, previous prophet, revelation). Greatest favor on human is God's revelation and guidance. isn't it logical to think that God will declare the end of revelation?"

religion,lgrjzl,Is there any religion you respect less than others? Why?,"Christianity because of people who claim to be Christian but don't know the first thing about their religion. I love Christ and I would say most Christians are good people. But I get annoyed when people claim to be Christian and ask the most basic questions, the answers could be found in the Bible but if course they don't read that. Most Christians today are ignorant and misguided because of this. They don't read Gods word but instead rely on other people to tell them what it says. A dangerous practice because  many people lie and say ""the Bible says this and that"" when it doesn't. I don't mean to offend anyone but if the words in the Bible really meant eternal life like they claim why would you even think of letting someone else tell you what's inside, instead of reading it for yourself? Something only an idiot would do."

religion,lgpzrv,Atma and Anatma,"In Hinduism, Atma or Atman is the eternal Self, which is infinite, self-existing, transcendental and indestructible, and Anatma is all that which is not the Self. Anatma represents the dependent, destructible, transient objective reality. Hindus believe in the existence of both Atma and Anatma. According to it, the eternal Self is caught in the cycle of births and deaths, as it is enveloped by the impurities of Nature and remains so until they are removed through spiritual transformation and purification. Buddhists do not believe in the eternal Self, but the not-self. For them, there is nothing eternal in existence. All reality or existence is impermanent and objectified in both gross and subtle realms and constitutes the not-self reality. The beings are also a part of that not-self reality, and what exists in them and around them is also the dependent, destructible not-self. Each of them represents the same not-self or the objective-self, made up of aggregates of parts (khandas) and consciousness or awareness in various states of ignorance. They are caught in the cycle of births and deaths, and remain so until they achieve liberation."

* However, the problem I have with this is that it seems unfair. Unless I'm wrong, when you are reincarnated, you don't have any memories of your past life, and your personality may be different as well. If this is true, then you are essentially a completely different person, so is it fair that you have to suffer in your current life for the actions that were committed by someone that was essentially a different person than you?"

I have a really deep respect for all religions, and while many have very problematic histories, I consider religion to be a quintessentially human thing—just like the humans that created religion, religion is flawed but also can be immensely beautiful. I might not agree or believe in many religions, but I acknowledge that the typical purpose of religion is to allow for communities to form and to try and seek answers to life. My best friend is, on the other hand, incredibly anti-religious. Thinks that every religion is terrible and disgusting and that every religious place should be torn down and that the people who believe in those religions are upholders of the entire history of their religion and that they should, therefore, not actually believe in the religion because of the past terrible histories religions have. The animosity is one which is quite upsetting to me, and while we agreed mutually to not discuss religion, I’m still really struggling with what to do about this because I myself am heavily involved in trying to fix our shared university religious space, while she has been adamantly against it. Is there a way I can try and reconcile this different belief? I just don’t know how to go about remaining friends with someone who seems to have such a disparate view; but then again I know many people have friends or family who are on opposite religious or political spectrums, and so I’m just looking for advice on how to make this work?"

religion,lg8w4m,Christians and people interested in Christianity should read the Didache,"There's often a bit of confusion on this sub when some people, asking about this or that and whether it is in the Bible or what the Bible says, are told that the Bible isn't actually the rulebook for Christians. Certainly it contains teachings, but it was never intended to be a comprehensive rulebook and that's not why the particular books that make up the Bible were chosen.

However the early Christians actually did have a rulebook - the Didache, or 'The Lord's Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations'. This is possibly the earliest specifically Christian writing apart from the letters, and given it was written and read by the earliest generations of Christianity it is well worth reading, especially if you believe in Apostolic Succession and Tradition. Its also really not very long.

Turns out the evil spirits are actually a consequence of mental illness. Now I'm left with doubts of my identity. I still feel the love of God and I still feel the love of the Gods, but I'm left wondering if it's really all in my head.

I am a born muslim but right now i am experiencing some doubts and i am not feeling good. You see I am muslim, believe in one God, and i believe Muhammad PBUH is last and final prophet of God. But i never understood some things like Salah: Why would God care when and how we pray, are we clean when pray, in what positions are we when we pray etc. I never did daily salah like it is prescribed i pray my own way, by reciting Surahs from Quran and also pray in my own language and I feel that is completely fine. My parents never forced me to pray or anything, but my Father did teach me about Islam and taught me some Surahs. I can understand the Ramadan fast, it cleans you and I usually fast few days, never actually did whole month, but those few days really boost my faith.
I really believe that what Islam teaches about ONE GOD is the truth but some things just arent logical to me 🙄. I hope that if I said anything wrong here that Allah will forgive me. I believe that God is also the most merciful and really can forgive if we sincerely seek forgivness and that gives me hope. And also since I started praying my way and asking Allah for forgivness and maybe something I needed, like knowledge for tests etc. my life really became better 😄. And also I read translation of Quran every morning and every evening and is also making me feel more of a believer.

religion,lfyp63,Buddhism Vs. Hinduism Similarities and Differences,"As we study Buddhism and Hinduism, it becomes fascinatingly clear how these two traditions benefited from an intense rivalry between them in the land of their birth. It may sound paradoxical but it is true that in their attempt to assert themselves and establish their superiority they mutually strengthened their respective belief systems and philosophical ideas, drawing profusely from each and without compromising their own. Buddhism originated as an alternative faith to Vedic religion, but in due course it made several compromises to its original doctrine to resolve its own internal schisms and doctrinal matters which were not fully resolved or clarified or elaborated by the Buddha and his immediate disciples.

The two traditions are identical in many respects and dissimilar in many others. They mutually influenced each other and were benefited by each other’s strengths as well as weaknesses. When you study them, you cannot fail to notice how the same beliefs and concepts assume different connotations and shades of meaning in each tradition. As a Hindu Buddhist, I am fascinated by the fact that I can relate to the best of the beliefs and practices of both these religions and assimilate them into a philosophy of my own, without suffering from incongruity or compromising my fundamental faith.

Since they originated in the same soil and shared the same social, religious, spiritual and geographical milieus for a long time, it is but natural that they assimilated the wisdom of numerous teachers and scholar who lived in the same environment and often shared their wisdom or resolved their differences through debates and discussions. Both traditions attempt to address the most striking problem of our lives namely Death, and aim to resolve it through liberation in their own ways. In that process, they not only strike different paths but also share many common beliefs and practices.

For example, the deity of Death (Yama) who appears in many Buddhist paintings and who is worshipped in many sects of Buddhism is the same god of Death who is mentioned in the Upanishads as the first manifestation of Brahman (Shiva or Isvara) upon earth. It is the same deity with a different name (Mahakala) who manifests before Arjuna in the Bhagavadgita as the universal form of Brahman. He appears in the Katha Upanishad as Yama, a spiritual teacher. He is known as Rudra, Bhairava, etc., in Hinduism, and Mara, Vajrabhairava, Yama, etc., in Buddhism. He is the enforcer of justice (dharmapala) in both traditions. He is Yama for the ignorant and Yamantaka for the enlightened. This image of Death with fierce eyes and a terrible form symbolizes the mortality and impermanence of life in both traditions. This is but one example of how similar and yet dissimilar the two are.

In the following discussion, we examine 20 common beliefs and practices of both traditions, and see where they agree and disagree. Readers may please note that Buddhism and Hinduism have numerous sects and schools. They widely vary in their beliefs, practices and philosophical interpretations. Therefore, whatever comparison we have drawn here may not necessarily reflect all the diversity, complexity, contradictions and exceptions found in them. This is just a broad overview, or rather an oversimplification in some respects, which should give you a fairly good understanding of their comparative features arising from their prolonged historical and geographical relationship."

If you believe that a conscious being, that lives outside space and time, spoke the universe into existence, you believe unfalsifiable nonsense. 

If you believe that a snake talked to a rib woman, who’s husband was made of dirt, and convinced her to eat some magical fruit, you believe mythological nonsense. 

If you believe that a 600 year old man built a zoo boat to survive the flooding of the entire earth, you believe scientifically inaccurate and impossible nonsense. 

If you believe that one family repopulated the entire earth, in under 6000 years, you believe incestuous and biologically impossible nonsense. 

If you believe that the creator of the universe told a man to murder his son and offer him up as a burnt sacrifice, you believe evil nonsense. 

If you believe that approximately 1.5 million Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, whose population was only approximately 4-5 million, and then Egypt failed to record it, you believe ahistorical nonsense. 

If you believe that the creator of the universe murdered the first born males of Egypt as a way to flex on the pharaoh, you believe genocidal nonsense. 

If you believe a man survived three days and three nights inside the belly of a large fish, you believe crazy nonsense. 

If you believe that a first century, heretical, apocalyptic, Palestinian, itinerant rabbi was the son/incarnation of the creator of the universe and was resurrected after being dead for three days, which caused the dead of Jerusalem to climb out of their graves and walk around town, you believe some top-tier, certifiably crazy, Walking Dead level nonsense. 

If you believe that Judgment Day is right around the corner, you believe existentially dangerous nonsense. 

Honestly, I don’t care how arrogant it sounds; if you believe most of the stuff in the Bible, you believe absolute nonsense, and you should be ashamed. Your beliefs are without evidence and a detriment to human civilization. Stop believing Bronze Age nonsense and catch up, before it’s too late. Close your Bible and open a textbook for a change; you might learn something other than complete nonsense."

About a year ago, I had to quit my job because the pain in my leg and lower back was excruciating. It was so bad I went from working 12 hour shifts to four hour shifts and not even being able to fully work those hot shifts...so after MRI’s and many doctor appointments... I learn I have two disc L4 and L5, phase 3 of decaying... causing chronic lower back pain and sciatic on top of that.. they say I have degenerative disc disease.. well months for by, I’m still in pain every single btw... and I mean literally 24/7 a day, I didn’t walk the first 3 months.. They had me on 8 different types of medication when it all started, thankfully I only take a few now to help calm the nerves but yet.. I still can not work. I feel helpless... 
I found a surgeon I felt comfortable enough to start talking surgery’s and what I can do to not have such a burden in my life anymore.. it’s completely tore me down mentally and even physically.. My schedule surgery for back surgery is February 22nd.. 
Anyways, everyone has their own opinion when it comes to religion and honestly I don’t even want to bring it into this post BUT the biggest part of all of these deals with me praying to God to lead me in the right path, the surgery has me nervous to BITS.. I am 24 years old.... I asked God to show me a sign, any sign.. if it wasn’t meant for me to have the surgery, or if something bad would happen, to just make me stop hurting.. and remember I’d been dealing with unbearable pains for literally a year.. when I started thinking back on it the last two weeks have been really good for me I haven’t been hurting nearly at all unless I’m up for way too long on my feet, which 10 minutes used to KILL ME. Now, I’m not so sure exactly what my question is but HELP HELP HELP.. I’m second guessing things and I know it could possibly just be a coincidence and that the degenerative disc orange just going to fix themselves or go away...  but now to finally not have any pain after so long... just has me thinking SO MUCH. Because of where the surgery will be it will potentially take 6 to 10 months to heal and that’s just so much more time, idk what to do anymore."

For almost all of my life I have been practicing Judaism and consider myself a ba'al teshuvah (a returner to Judaism) even though by Jewish law I am technically not considered a Jew because my mother is a gentile but am rather a zera yisrael or child of a Jewish father. I have wanted to convert to Orthodox Judaism for years and always assumed that by the time I am of age that I will, but recently many aspects of the Catholic religion have attracted me to it and I find myself thinking theologically in an increasingly Christian manner as opposed to a strictly Jewish one. One of my dilemmas is the fact that if I were to convert to Judaism I would have to abandon many aspects of my Korean heritage that would be deemed idol worship by Jewish rabbis such as the veneration of ancestors that the Catholic Church tolerates. Another is the fact that there are now denominations of Catholicism established for people of Jewish descent to observe traditional Judaism under the patronage of the Catholic Church so if I were to be Catholic I would theoretically be able to have the best of both worlds. On the flip side, I sometimes feel that being a Catholic would be a betrayal to my Jewish ancestors who have often suffered persecution at the hands of the Catholic Church as well as the fact that few American Jewish the modern day are observant and that the American Jewish community needs more religious practitioners to ensure it's perpetuity."

I wasn't given a choice as to whether or not I wanted to follow the religion since all of my family is some denomination of Christianity and my grandpa is a preacher at a church, which I was forced to attend. 

I can't really escape it since it's ingrained in my family, their traditions, opinions, and it affects basically everything. I don't believe in the Christian god, I don't even think I believe in a god period. But over time I'll start to feel guilty and basically ""relapse"" into the religion. I'll think everything I'm doing is wrong, like, *everything.* I'm married and choosing to have sex with my husband? A sin. I have an opinion that isn't a ""good"" opinion? A sin. I'm eating a snack when I'm not really super hungry? A sin. I'm thinking a ""bad"" thought about someone? A sin. And for all of those, as well as choosing to not believe in god, I'm going to hell. 

Does anyone else have this issue? I'm like, almost obsessing over a religion I don't even want to be apart of anymore, I'm obsessing over a religion I'm trying to get away from, and I'm obsessing over ""sinning"" when I don't even believe in it.

Everything else about Islam is based on Islam itself (Quran, Messenger Mohamed, stories, sayings, etc.) and I am starting to slowly loose belief in all of this.

On a side note, it is never stated in the bible that ALL demons and fallen angels are under Satan's boot. It is quite possible that many act of their own accord.

I didn't come here to call any religion out specifically or bicker with anyone, nor do I think that this has ever been addressed objectively. 

There are a lot of religions/religious denominations out there and at face value, most seem to have pretty positive belief systems (value life, don't lie/cheat, treat others as you would like to be treated, etc.). However, these belief systems seem to be all to frequently perverted for the gains of powerful people within the church, govt., etc.. There are countless examples of this. To be fair, there are also countless examples of good deeds done in the name of religion. The fact that so many negative things are done in the name of religion, even by leaders in that religion, is endlessly bothersome and seems to negate much of the positive aspects of religion.

religion,lcdr2r,The Church of Atheism,"Hello Religion!

I wanted to potentially start a discourse regarding atheism. I have been exploring the atheist community here but primarily on YouTube and had some thoughts that I would love to have dispelled or discussed.

Is Atheism not a church? I know it is not a secular religion as it has no relation to spirituality but it does carry some of the common practices of both standard religions and even more extreme religions.

Atheism is the strict belief that a God or Gods cannot exist. Now this belief alone is founded heavily in faith, that faith being that you know all there is to know in the universe. If you did not know everything in the universe it would be impossible to say without a doubt that a God or Gods cannot exist. Therefore the people who do not subscribe to standard secular beliefs or refuse to be a part of a church could only ever be agnostic, acknowledging they don't know everything but still not submitting to a religion.

In the atheist community I have peered into have a strict adherence to such beliefs as; church's are a detriment to thinking people, God cannot exist and to raise a child in a religion is morally reprehensible as it is brainwashing. Anyone who veers away from these beliefs is either written off as crazy or mocked. This makes me believe it is just as much of a church as the ones they mock so mercilessly. They even go as far as to constantly try to convert people to becoming atheist.

If you believe in a book, that is amazing and beautiful as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. But just because your book has the word Chemistry on it that doesn't make it any more true. Many site the fact that there is real world evidence for science and claim that this is why they know for certain that science trumps religion. They do this all while believing in the big bang and evolution because wise men told them that it is true. My prophet is Erico and yours is Stephen Hawking, we both believe in a book and trust the words of another. We are not different.

Thank you for reading my observations and thoughts on atheism, I hope to read your opinions below, E.

(Side note, before I get bombarded with comments regarding the use of experimentation to prove science to be the answer to everything. You have not conducted a tenth of the experiments needed to validate your beliefs so you are still operating on faith to a great extent.)"
religion,lcdecp,Reasons that I doubt Jesus:,"1) How we know that the scriptures are telling the truth? What if some people wrote the texts of the Old Testament and lied that it was the word of God in order to bring some order in the world or gain leadership? What if in the future, some other people decided to make new writings (New Testament) based on the Old Testament in order to lie about the prophecy being fulfilled so they can bring some new order in the world?

2) There also, other texts about God or Gods, for example, Hindu texts or Qur'An. Why we should reject them as false texts but believe that the texts of Christianity are the truth?

3) Will Christian God send people who have different religion to hell for keeping their religion, even though they heard the gospel? Why? If someone is born in a country that many people have a different religion than Christianity and is brainwashed to believe that his religion is the right one, I cant blame him for rejecting Christianity. If a Muslim would tell you to reject Christianity because Qur'An is the real word of God, would you become a Muslim? No, because you truly, believe that Christian Bible is the real word of God. That goes the same with Muslims. Even though, they know or have heard the gospel, they cant change religion because they truly, think that their religion is the right one and try to follow it. Would Christian God send those people to hell for being deluded or brainwashed? If the Bible says that, then, to me it seems suspicious.

4) what about some differences in verses that look like contradictions? For example, in Genesis did God create animals before or after Adam? what about this?

religion,lcbo2h,What type of Religion is better monotheistic religion or Polytheistic Religion?,"I personally feel Polytheistic Religion is better than monotheistic religion because being in a polytechnic religion makes a person more tolerant for other religions then monotheistic religion.

To support my view I would like to give you an example of some biggest religions (In 
terms of followers). There are 2 types of religions one is abrahamic religions and Religions that originated in India .

If we see all abrahamic Religions are monotheistic as they believe there is only one God but each believe that their version is the only correct version because of which there is haterade between these Religions till date and there have been multiple wars , Crusade , terrorist activities because of this belive that their religion is the only true religion and everyone else is worshipping devil.

However when you take 3 major religions from india , Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism they all believe that there is only one God but he/she can exist in multiple forms due to which there is no only true path to reach god , it can be done by following multiple paths. Due to which there have never been any major problems between these Religions since the beginning of these Religions till date.

The reason this happens is because when one believes that his Religions is the Only True Religion they declare that everyone else's belief system is false and since no one has any solid proof that their religion is the right Religion it creates conflict however on the other hand when you are told that god's can exist in multiple forms and can be reached through multiple ways then even if you encounter someone from a different Religion you tend to believe that this is his way of reaching god , it may not be similar to mine but that doesn't makes it incorrect due to which there is less hatred among people as they tend to respect others believes."
religion,lcbo0n,Religious but,"I grew up in a family of atheist but I was always a seeker. From time to time I have been leaning against Christianity and spent much time in churches and reading the Bible but not really believing. I never really “felt” anything, and since some years I stopped going to churches and am more skeptical towards Christianity and traditional religions in general. 
However, I always had and still have a strong feeling that there is “something” bigger then us. Some kind of creator perhaps. Some kind of higher power. I don’t call it God, but I don’t know what to call it. For me personally it’s the only thing that makes sense. That something created us and everything.

religion,lcbgku,Yet another fake news of faith?,"Recently I saw a post on an atheist group in Facebook of a link to a news article that states: “Scientists have declared that believing in God is a mental illness”. The post got a lot of likes so I naturally wanted to learn more about this. Turns out this was just a translation from an Indian article on ‘India Today’ - Do you believe in God? Some consider it a mental illness. 

The article states that the APA conducted a 5 years of study led by Dr. Andrews which concludes that faith in God is a form of mental illness. I could not find anything about a 5 year old study by APA on relation between faith and mental illness, any sources in both of the news articles nor any other information about such study and Dr. Andrews, which I do not even know if she exists.

What struck me is that so many people liked and shared this post from the atheist group. Turns out people are easy to manipulate and mislead, no matter if they believe in God or not. I think there are very smart and well educated people on both sides of the “God argument”, but the majority of the population is still more or less, naive and dare I say - stupid. It’s not like I am the sharpest tool in the box, but it is not so hard to at least try to fact check something you read/hear, before blindly believing it.

UPDATE: The site in which I saw the article is a total facade. I found the original source and it is a deleted article from a satire media, which is presented as factual. Also, when I gave the article 1/5 stars it was not even counted. When I tried to leave a comment, but was replaced by an auto-generated message that supported the author’s views and I was unable to delete it. I have never before seen such display of not only what is obviously false news, but a clear manipulation on ratings and comments. I wrote an email to the website but needless to say I do not expect any response or at least a sensible one."

religion,lc5fs8,Critical Evaluation,"The Vaishesika theory of nonexistence has several limitations. The proponents of it spoke mainly of perceptual or physical nonexistence since they relied upon direct experience (pratyaksha) and inference to draw their conclusions. For example, an object such as a pot may physically become nonexistent upon its destruction, but the idea or the mental image of that object or pot may continues even after its nonexistence. If a person leaves in our presence, it does not mean that the person has become nonexistent or that the nonexistence of that person will be eternal.

Further, the parts or the elements which make up that object still remain in a broken condition. The pot as such is gone, but its residue survives and continues in another form. Its  name and form disappear but the material which make it continue. An object may also become nonexistent when it undergoes transformation and becomes something else as in case of a seed becoming a plant upon germination. The seed itself must have arisen from another plant before it existed as seed. In such situations it is difficult to say that antecedent nonexistence has no beginning or consequential nonexistence has no end.

It is also difficult to establish absolute nonexistence. How can we ever prove the absolute nonexistence of anything when we have no knowledge of it and no means to ascertain it? The Vaishesikas also largely ignored the role played by impermanence in the existence and nonexistence of things. Things are constantly in a state of decay. They undergo momentary changes. They are never the same.

In an impermanent phenomenal world, things constantly become nonexistent, moment by moment, and new things with slight modification emerge from them. You are not the same person which you were a few moments ago. Although those minute and momentary changes may not be visible or perceptible to the naked eye, they do happen constantly when we look at them at the microscopic, atomic or quantum levels.

For example, take the human body or a flowing river. They undergo constant changes moment by moment, which means they are never the same. The water in the river flows constantly. They body undergoes numerous changes at the cellular level. As these changes take place, they become nonexistent each moment and are replaced by a new version of them. How can we account for these types of changes, or ignore the reality that existence and nonexistence may have a much closer affinity and role in the manifestation of things, and neither is continuous, independent or absolute? It is even possible that nonexistence may be a state of existence only, which we cannot perceive or make sense of. The black holes and the dark material of the universe may some of the phenomena where we may come to know more about existence and nonexistence and their relationship."

(I mention this bc I know there'll be some people who will find this shocking and may wonder if I'm making it up). 

The concept of ""religion"" was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries,[3][4] despite the fact that 
ancient sacred texts like the Bible, the Quran, and others did not have a word or even a concept 
of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these 
sacred texts were written.[5][6]
The word religion as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation 
into non-European languages. The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that ""what the West 
and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something 
quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history"".[7] The history of other 
cultures' interaction with the ""religious"" category is therefore their interaction with an idea that first 
developed in Europe under the influence of Christianity.
[8][need quotation to verify]
The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious things were separated from worldly 
things, was not used before the 1500s.[25] The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to 
distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities.[25]
The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, 
is a recent invention in the English language. Such usage began with texts from the 17th century 
due to events such as the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and 
globalization in the age of exploration, which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures 
with non-European languages.[23][24][28] Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not 
appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures.[29][30] Others argue that using 
religion on non-Western cultures distorts what people do and believe.[31]
he concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries,[32][33] despite the fact that ancient 
sacred texts like the Bible, the Quran, and others did not have a word or even a concept of 
religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred 
texts were written.[34][35] For example, there is no precise equivalent of religion in Hebrew, and 
Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.[36] One of its central concepts is halakha, meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law, which 
guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.[37] Even though the beliefs and 
traditions of Judaism are found in the ancient world, ancient Jews saw Jewish identity as being 
about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated 
rituals.[38] Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ioudaismos, which 
some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to 
modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.[3] It was in the 19th century that Jews 
began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.[38] The Greek word 
threskeia, which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the 
New Testament. Threskeia is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, 
the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.[3] In the Quran, the Arabic 
word din is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators 
expressed din as law.[3] The Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes translated as religion, also means 
law.39][40]
Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did 
not align with Western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the 
sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, 
and world religions first entered the English language.[41][42][43] No one self-identified as a Hindu or 
Buddhist or other similar terms before the 1800s.[44] ""Hindu"" has historically been used as a 
geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the Indian 
subcontinent.
[45][46] Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of religion since there was 
no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American 
warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign 
treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this 
idea.[47][48]

God can't do non-sensical things such as a square circle so we could apply that here. He can't create matter/energy. Maybe he can put forth a force to rearrange things, though. To create life from the dust of the earth by rearranging the atoms that make up said dust.

Though, I think personification of God has its flaws/limits.

Idk, what do you guys think. Bible says we are made in his image but maybe he is his image and we are made of God because all there is is God."
religion,lbra8b,HOPE: Having Only Positive Expectations," The best way to understand hope is to understand its acronym, HOPE: Having Only Positive Expectations . Having said that, in one stage of life, we live with hope, we have positive expectations because we have faith. We trust God, we believe that good things will happen, we eliminate pessimism as we live with optimism. But everything that we hope for may not happen. If we truly want to live with hope we must have only positive expectations, but we must also go one step further, we must learn to surrender. We must surrender to the Divine will, knowing that the Divine knows more about what we need than we know and so while we must have only positive expectations, we must also live with surrender and acceptance."

It makes us start believing in God, loving God and seeking God. It also helps us to pray, but if we do not understand to whom we pray and what we pray, what we say when we pray, then we don't pray, in fact we bray. We should not just keep on saying things which make no sense, we should go beyond the kindergarten of religion, just like we go beyond school to university.

religion,lbpftm,I don't mean to offend anyone but can someone explain why the Trinity doctrine is held as a central Christian teaching?,"When the Jewish people don't believe it? The Bible was written by Jewish people, for Jewish people. And when Jesus arrived on earth he went to the Jews first.

Mathew 15:22
A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.”

23 Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”

24 He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”

25 The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.

26 He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”

27 “Yes Lord, she said. “But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”

He was sent to Israel first and foremost. In this story the children are the Israelites, the dogs are the gentiles. 

With that being said wouldn't the Israelites know their own God? Wouldn't they have the most knowledge about the God Christians profess to worship and shouldn't we trust them on the matter? Jesus said he was sent by God, they same God Jewish people have been worshiping for thousands of years. This being was always One, the Israelites were always monotheistic, every prophet that was sent to them affirmed this. Why now do we have so many people saying he is three in one or one in three?"

I'm new to this sub and just stopped by to ask a question for academic purposes. I'm a 12th grader and we have this subject called Introduction to World Religion &amp; Belief Systems. Now, for our final class before the semester ends, our teacher wants us to do something like a fellowship, but in the new normal setting so it's going to be done through an online conference. This activity will also serve as our final requirement for the subject. Now, the activity requires us to perform rituals of the religions we've tackled over the months, and our group was assigned to the Eastern Orthodox Church (a sub-religion of Christianity). My problem is I can't seem to find Orthodox Church rituals on the internet. All I'm getting online is that they have the 7 Sacraments (which I already know because I'm a Roman Catholic), and I can't find any ritual stuff or chants or prayers or such that we can perform on the fellowship.

So I'm here asking if yall know any simple rituals of the Eastern Orthodox Church which can be done in, say, 5 to 6 minutes? I know there will be concerns about religious appropriation and we've already told our teacher that but just shrugged us off and I guess we have no choice because this is for our final requirement, but rest assured we'll give our utmost respect in performing the said ritual.

I hope you guys can help me. I've been really anxious over the past few days with this activity in mind because I really can't seem to find valuable information on Google. Thanks in advance, folks!"

religion,lbenvk,Types of Nonexistence,"In Hinduism sat and asat, existence and nonexistence, are two fundamental states of the absolute reality known as Brahman. They are like the one and zero of the computer programming world. In this essay, we will discuss the last one, abhava or nonexistence of the Vaishesikas. This category was not originally included by the school in the list of categories, but was added later. The Vaishesika Sutras (9.1) identifies four types of nonexistence or four conditions in which nonexistence is perceived or cognized. They are described below.

Prag-abhava: This is antecedent nonexistence or the nonexistence of an effect or a thing prior to its production. It is not produced by any prior action, quality or concomitant condition. Hence, it has no beginning, but an end, which arises when the thing or the effect comes into existence. For example, a pot was placed upon a table. The pot was nonexistent before it was placed. The nonexistence of that pot had no beginning, but ended when the pot was placed.

Pradhvamsa-abhava: This is consequent nonexistence which arises consequent to the destruction of a thing. Since, it arises after the destruction of a thing or effect, it has a beginning, but no end. Also, the destruction breaks the continuity of existence since the existent thing does not continue as nonexistent thing. They are different realities. For example, when the pot on the table was destroyed, it becomes nonexistent upon its destruction. The nonexistence of that pot begins with destruction, and it will eternally continue since the same pot can never be brought back into existence.

Anonya-abhava: This is reciprocal nonexistence or nonexistence of relatable identity. It arises in relation to another thing, and is the opposite of anonya-bhava or the existence of one thing in relation to another.  For example, when we say a cow is not a horse, we are referring to the reciprocal nonexistence of both the cow and the horse in relation to each other. This type of nonexistence is eternal because the fact that a cow is not a horse remains forever. The reciprocal nonexistence makes the distinction (visesa) of each thing in relation to others an indisputable, particular and fundamental reality.

Atyanta-abhava: This is absolute nonexistence which is neither antecedent nor consequential nor reciprocal. It is also without a beginning and without an end and is not conditioned by any limiting factor as in case of the other three. Hence, it is absolute and eternal."

Economic and Scientific/Technological Globalisation forces would then create educational institutions that failed us in the 20 century (which Arendt referred to as ""this terrible century). Calls went out to establish International systems of Education and the calls have yet to be answered perhaps because Religion in its pure cosmopolitan spirit   has been eclipsed by a curious form of secularisation that has marginalised the kind of ethical thinking we find in the Philosophy of Aristotle and Kant.

religion,laodbn,The Vaishesikas’ View of Distinctive Realities,"The Vaishesikas were materialists who speculated upon the distinction (visesa) of various things which made up the perceptible and cognizable reality. They were pluralists, pure realists and pragmatists, who relied upon direct experience and inference to arrive at their conclusions, discarding all metaphysical notions found in the scriptures which could not be proved otherwise.

Their philosophy is well documented in the Vaishesika Sutras by Kanada (also known as Aulukva and Kasyapa) who probably lived in the fourth century BCE in northern India near the present-day Allahabad. Just as Samkhya and Yoga which have a historical affinity, Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools are usually mentioned together because of their close similarities as if they represent one system of thought. The school also attracted the attention of many Buddhist scholars in ancient times, due to its emphasis upon empirical evidence and logical thinking.

The Vaishesikas (and Jains) were probably the first in the world to perceive atoms and propose an atomic theory. The school believed that all material things were made up of the minutest atoms (paramanu), which were indivisible, eternal and indestructible. The permutations and combination of these atoms created the material diversity of things and objects. They divided the known, cognizable and identifiable reality formed by those atoms into seven categories or material divisions (padarthas).

In a general sense, padartha means any object or material. For example, food, water, air, earth, etc., are but padarthas only. In the Vaisheshika philosophy it refers to a category or division of Nature, or of perceptible and cognizable reality. The Samkhyas identified 23 such divisions or parts (tattvas). The Vaishesikas divided them into seven, with further subdivisions within each. The seven categories are dravya (substance), guna (quality), karma (activity), samanya (generality), vishesa (particularity), samavaya (concomitance), and abhava (nonexistence)."

\[Yogis\] know that the body is the instrument in which, and by which the Spirit manifests and works. They know that the fleshly covering is necessary for Man’s manifestation and growth in this particular stage of his development. They know that the body is the Temple of the Spirit. And they, consequently, believe that the care and development of the body is as worthy a task as is the development of some of the higher parts of Man, for with an unhealthy and imperfectly developed physical body, the mind cannot function properly, nor can the instrument be used to the best advantage by its master, the Spirit.

It is true that the Yogi goes beyond this point, and insists that the body be brought under the perfect control of the mind --  that the instrument be finely turned so as to be responsive to the touch of the hand of the master.

But the Yogi knows that the highest degree of responsiveness on the part of the body may be obtained only when it, the body, is properly cared for, nourished and developed. The highly trained body must, first of all be a strong healthy body. For these reasons the Yogi pays such great attention and care to the physical side of his nature, and, for the same reason, the Oriental system of Physical Culture forms a part of the Yogi science of Hatha Yoga.

The only reason I'm saying this is because my first choice of subreddit should tell you that I consider this opinion unpopular. However, it is not my intention to spark a controversy. Everything below, while being just an opinion, I consider logical and the only way I can understand those concepts I'm going to be talking about in regards to their core meaning in both English and my native language. It's just something I wanted to share and see if someone's going to agree with. Let's be civil. Here goes.

I don't know about you all, but I've seen a lot of atheists claiming that they don't ""believe there's no God"", but rather ""fundamentally lack any belief"", and this distinction is important because these are two different things. I would like to object, as while these are indeed different things, I don't see how a ""dictionary definition"" atheist lacks belief. The concept has always been simple to me: a human can only be in two binary cognitive states about anything, knowledge and belief.

Knowledge is inherently different from belief since it requires proof, and thus ""I don't know if it exists"" and ""I know it doesn't exist"" are two separate things. So, regarding an object, you can either know for certain that it exists/doesn't exist, or you don't know anything in that regard (I understand that you may be wrong about ""100% knowing"" something as the proof may be false, but for the sake of the argument let's assume that the proof just has to have you convinced and not contradict our previous knowledge of the Universe, which, by the way, is more or less the official stance of science). Belief, however, is by definition, an opinion without proof, for as soon as proof is introduced, it becomes knowledge. Thus, regarding an object's existence, you may either believe in it or believe in its non-existence. Completely lacking belief can only imply that your cognitive state about the object is in the sphere of knowledge: you either know it exists, or you don't know, you're unsure, you have no proof.

Since scientific proof of God's existence or non-existence is impossible, at least for now, you may either believe in his existence or believe in his non-existence. Thankfully, the sphere of knowledge offers us a semi-third choice by saying ""I just don't know"", but it's still difficult to sincerely not have an opinion about it in a world where this topic is still relevant. When scientists discuss equally valid mutually exclusive hypotheses, they choose to believe in the one that feels more correct to them until it's either proven or disproven. Einstein famously believed that the Observer effect in quantum physics didn't exist but was seemingly a manifestation of the particles' ""hidden parameters"".

So it's not surprising that many agnostics are still either believers or non-believers. It's not a contradiction because, as mentioned in my example with scientists, even if you don't know something, you usually have some kind of hypothesis about it and are hoping that humanity will learn the truth some day. While if you claim that you lack belief, you can only ""know"" or ""not know"" about it.  If, instead of saying ""I don't know"", you claim that God doesn't exist, you don't ""lack belief"", you believe in his non-existence.

So, this brings the question: with that said, if we can't prove God's non-existence, should we consider it in scientific theories? Absolutely not. Time has proven that, whether God exists or not, unless he explicitly manifests somehow, it has absolutely no impact on our results and findings. Our experiments with bodies and particles are consistent, our formulae add up to the same numbers. If, in this paradigm, we choose to not believe in God, nothing changes. If we choose to believe, we must assume that God probably created the Universe the way we theorise it to be, with the Big Bang, evolution and all that stuff. That would, of course, go against many religions and be closer to deism, but would still not interfere with our scientific results. But wait, you may ask, does this mean that we unironically have to consider the possibility that there's an invisible incorporeal porcelain teapot orbiting the Sun? Yes. While we, again, don't need to include its existence into our calculations unless it somehow interferes with our data, there is no way to prove or disprove it, but you are free to choose whether you believe in its existence or non-existence, unless being a ""believer"" bothers you for some reason."

Religious people have done quite a lot of good, just as they have done bad. Many people are good people driven by their religion and get their code of morality from their belief in God and have demonstrated altruistic behaviour, while many others have demonstrated hate and violence."

[They think that the duty imposed on them of being loyal to God is fulfilled by merely observing certain rites and rituals. They should know that] loyalty to God does not merely mean that you face the East or the West [in the prayer]but loyalty is the loyalty of those who believe in God [with all their heart] and in the Last Day and in the angels of God and in His Books and in His prophets and who, though they love it dearly, give away their wealth to kinsfolk,to orphans,to the destitute, to the traveller and to those who ask and for the liberation of necks and who are diligent in the prayer and pay zakah (charity); [and loyalty is the loyalty of those who] when make a promise fulfill it and especially [of those] who are steadfast in scarcity, illness and in times of war.These are the people who are truthful [to God in fulfilling the promise of loyalty to Him] and these are the ones who are in fact God-conscious."

One time I had a child who was sick in hospital. I went to front for prayer. The visiting pastor said infront of everyone I wasnt praying or fasting enough and I couldn't depend for others to do it. No one jumped to my defense. I left with blaming myself for my child's sickness. Also same time I was being abused by my x. I became full of guilt and suicidal. I stopped going. No one contacted me, no one called about my child nothing. I finally overcame the guilt. We didn't go for a year. A family member never stopped going and begged us to come back, so we did. I finally got rid.of my abusive x. I struggled financially but never said anything. I was a mess and my health started failing. I started to heal but health got worse. They did know about my health. Then covid hit and with my health I stopped going to protect myself. They didn't wear masks or social distance. Even after covid made some sick still didn't mask or social distance. So I just watched it online because they were also packed in there. I have 4 diseases racking my body so my boyfriend moved in to help me. We do nothing wrong. Even if we did it's no one business. Well then the election happened and the sad event of January 6.  I am a non-affiliated registered voter. I like everyone else posted things about it on Facebook. I know who I vote for is my business so I never share. Well they have yet contacted me in months but 1 time. My health continues to drop and no word or offer of prayer. Well someone high up in the church took me off their Facebook and I didn't know why. The information came to me it's because I posted political stuff. I went and looked and people they and me are friends with they do nothing but post political garbage. I mainly post funny pictures and animal videos. I know that can't be it. They never wrote and talked to me. The bible is clear if you have a problem with a brother or sister in Christ you are to go to them. I have been shunned and this has happened many times in this faith. I don't look like them. I can't figure out what I did and I shouldn't have to go and ask them. I was looking forward to go back after vaccine. What did I do? Why are Christians like this? There are so many churches in America no one should go hungry. I feel if I had money they would care more.

religion,l9anhh,Helping my friend,"I've been wanting to seek advice on how to help my friend who is having strange dreams about God. She started having dreams of God a little over and year ago and would often be told to do things from him. It started small with her being told to make donations to charity and spread the good news. She had even converted to veganism at some point too.  
But then she started having more serious dreams where she was told to fast for three days without any food or water. She fasted the first two days and ate something small on the third day, and the same night she dreamed of hell. She was so afraid it scarred her. 
From then she devoted to doing everything God said in her dreams. She started donating larger sums of money towards donation sites, and has even attempted to move into a stranger's house believing they would care for her (this was during the pandemic where there were strict lockdown mesures). She mentioned having graphic dreams relating to maternity but did not explain in detail. Her behaviour changed significantly, making her sleeping more than usual, ignoring people when they're speaking to her, and reciting verses from the bible over and over.
Her family tried speaking to her about the issue, but she would cry and often ignore her family members when speaking. Her parents couldnt do much to help because of the language barrier, so her older siblings helped get her into therapy. She received medications to help, but stated if her condition did not improve, she would need to be transferred to a mental hospital. 
She has not been baptized and is planning on doing so in february, and her family is trying their best to help her but is unsure of what to do. Ever since her dreams about God started occurring, her relationship with her family started to become more distant and unbearable to the point where none of her family member tries to communicate with her anymore. 
She is very naive and pure making her vulnerable to potential harm and risks. Without knowing it was a scammer, she had conversed with a complete stranger about purchasing a bible. She had tried seeking help on her own and spoke with online counselors to alleviate her fear. But it had only deepened her fears of being punished by God. 
She has been my friend for the longest and helped me out whenever I needed it. She means so much to me and her family, and it would be much appreciated if I could have some suggestions on how to help out in this situation.

Thank you for reading"
religion,l9a40s,Poor Countries Tend to be more Religious,"From my observations and research, I believe that poverty is related to religion.

The places around the world which experiences poverty tend to be more religious. I believe the reason for this is that these certain countries lack access to education, time, and resources. People tend to view religion as some sort of comfort blanket or a promise of something much better.  Most of the countries around the world are religious, but it doesn't mean that they're poor. It's just that poor countries tend to be **more** religious than the average country.

This is just my **opinion** about this topic. This probably doesn't apply to every country that experiences similar problems.

Anyways, it would be greatly appreciated if you could give me comments or feedback about this topic.

The Jewish/Christian/Muslim creation myth is for example obviously an allegory for disobedience and the loss of innocence. No god would just leave the tree of knowledge and the tree of life unguarded for people to eat from. 

It's widely accepted that oral traditions are less concerned with Truth with a capital T and more concerned with meaning. I therefore suspect that the dinosaurs-in-Eden theme parks in America and the fundamentalist belief in creation stories that we see now is a modern, reactionary trend, which tries to marry scientism with allegorical folk traditions from the long, long ago. 

It's a bad match, methinks."
religion,l8ikph,I am worrying for something that I cant remember,"  I am a man and I am using an account from an other user by bying it. 2,5 years ago, I was outside, across from the building in which my old apartment was. I think, there was/were plate/plates of cat food/water or something like these, I do not remember exactly. It could have been just, food or just, water or both or nothing related to that. Anyway, my ocd started telling me to do a compulsion about these. I cant remember exactly what the compulsion was about. I think, my ocd was giving me probably, false alarms about the cat food/water that it could be dangerous for the cat. Maybe the plate/plates were near plants and I was afraid that something may fall into the plate and position it or maybe the plates were near rust or dirty. Anyway, I think I moved the plate/plates to a safer spot.

 I think, the way I put them were forming a shape along with other object/objects. I think, ocd started telling me that I need to rearrange their/its position in order to break the shape because it may be something like a ritual that causes a curse or something like that. I think, I remember spending some time rearranging again and again the objects. I think, one of the object was a pot or something like that. Maybe I did the cross sign 3 times on the object/objects in order to cancel any hypothetical curse. (just, typical ocd stuff) I do not remember anything else.

 My ocd is telling me that I may have made a real promise to Christian God and asked for a specific punishment and maybe if in case Christian God is not real, other Gods accepted the promise. I may have made the promise to force myself using the fear of the punishment to stop worrying about that compulsions. I cant remember making a promise. In the stsate that I was I would not dare to make a real promise and ask for that specific punishment. In the past, I was forced to make promises and ask for punishment (without wanting) in order to force myself ignore my ocd. What if the same thing happened with that plates/pots? Maybe I had some intrusive thoughts about a promise but I cant remember making a real promise and validating it. (I would not dare) But what if I was so anxious that I rushy, made a real promise, asked for a specific punishment in case breaking it and validate it? It is just, an hypothesis. I cant remember making a real promise.

 That spot was across from the buliding in which my old apartment was. Almost. everyday, whenever I was out, I was near that spot. It easily, entered my field of view. I think, I never got worried for that spot. If I made a promise, I would remember it and avoid even looking at that spot. I cant remember something EXACTLY like that. I think, there were some times that I was getting a bad feeling and was avoiding even, looking at that spot but that was probably, because of my ocd hypothesis. I do not remember making a promise. I remember less scary, and random, intrusive thoughts about other things but I do not remember anything about that spot. Yet, I feel as if there are  chances that I may have made a promise.

 What if I got so anxious and could not ignore my ocd which was telling me to rearrange the object/objects that I rushly, tried to make a real promise, ask for that specific punishment and validated it? I would not dare but what if I got so anxious that I did it and later, forgot it? 

Before that in the past, I prayed and tried to make clear that I do not want to make promises and that I am making them because of my ocd. I tried to make clear that a promise would count only if I understand what I am trying to promise, if I mean it and if I validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times. (I meant that the cross signs must be done on me like when we start/finish a prayer)

 I cant remember if that night, I tried to make such a promise. I remember ocd telling me to rearrange again and again the object/objects and me getting frustrated. What if upon my frustration I tried to make a REAL promise and ask for a specific punishment? Why I have those bad feelings? is this just, an hypothesis of my ocd? and even if, I made a promise, did Gods accepted it? I do not want to make promises. I do not want to be punished! I just, fall in the traps of my ocd and try to make promises to make my ocd stop bugging me like:

ocd: do the compulsion

me: no!

ocd: do it!

me: leave me alone

ocd: do it do it!


me: i do not want to do it.  (at that moment, i make a promise that I wont do the action of the compulsion etc)


ocd: do NOT do the compulsion because you made a promise!


me: glad we agree! now, I am free!!!"

religion,l8ho62,Theory of Nonexistence,"What is nonexistence? Is it the absence or dissolution of something? What do we mean by absence? Does it mean the physical absence or the perceptual absence or the absolute absence of something we can never know or imagine? Does it arise before anything comes into existence or after it is destroyed? Whether nonexistence precedes or follows existences and whether it coexists with it? Is existence a continuation of nonexistence, and vice versa? Does it arise in relation to the existence of something? Whether the mere disappearance of something or the physical invisibility of something can be construed as nonexistence?

These and many other questions were speculated by numerous scholars and philosophers in ancient India. They were interested in knowing how reality manifested or things came into existence, and whether nonexistence was a condition or a cause that preceded existence. If it was so, whether there was any relationship or continuity between them. Prominent among them were Vaishesikas, who represented a school of philosophy which is now considered one of the six main philosophical schools (Darshanas) of Hinduism."

religion,l8hfpn,What John 20:23 means? Should we confess to priests or to Jesus directly?," Hello, I am a man. I think, in John 20:23 it clearly, says that disciples gained the ability to forgive sins. I think, there is also a verse that says that they gained the ability to cast out demons. Some disagree that what Jesus meant was that they should spread the gospel and give the chance to people to ask for forgiveness directly from Jesus. In my opinion that could be wrong, because if the disciples decide not to share the gospel with someone, that someone is not guilty because he/she has not heard/learnt the Truth. Since, the disciplines gained the ability to cast out demons, cant we assume that what Jesus meant with John 20:23 is that He gave the ability to his disciples to forgive sins. But if thats the case, then, if someone sins (insults someone due to anger, or entertain himself with some sexual thoughts) does not that put him into a danger of going to hell? (if in case 1 unrepented sin can lead to hell?) I think, confession to a priest is not done regulary. I think, they are specific dates and is like an appointment. 

 Lets say that someone has just, repented by confessing to a priest. and some hours later, he sins because he got angry with someone for example. Maybe he will need to wait for 1-2 days or even more to confess to a priest again. Does not that put him into a risk of going to hell?"
religion,l8hd1z,"Do Christian churches have more or stricter rules than it really, needs?","I can understand that skipping the main gatherin of the church could be a sin but what about the other days that the church has gatherings? For example, for the celebration of a Saint? Is it a sin if I skip those gatherins but attend only, church on Sunday? I am not sure if the Bible clearly condemns skipping church. I think, there is a verse that says not to neglect going to the gatherings but I am not sure if it condemns it as a sin. Going to church helps your faith. Does the Bible clearly condemns it? It could be a sin but what about the other days that a church may have a ceremonty (to celebrate for a Saint for example)? Is it still, a sin if I attend church on Sundays but avoid going to other gatherings?

Does the Bible say that we need to fast Friday and Wednesday? Does the Bible say that we need to fast for 40 days?

All these seems like a burden to me. I can understand that someone should read the Bible, pray to God, repent, maybe attend church EVERY Sunday but is it necessary for someone to fast for 40 days? is it necessary to go to church every time the church has a gathering? (not only Sunday but other days too?)

I think, Paul founded churches in order to spread the gospel and that churches had established these rules. But, since many years has passed since then, how we know that there has not been a misunderstanding? What if church has some more or stricter rules than it really needs? Do churches agree with each other? If churches do not agree with each other then, we can assume that easily, there could be a misunderstanding after so many years.

That is why I am asking about Bible verses. Are there Bible verses that cleary say that skipping church gatherings (any day) is a sin? Does the Bible say that not fasting for 40 days is a sin? Can I have those verses?"

religion,l8fuig,The Challenge of God,"When magic were highly valued in ancient Egypt prophet Moses bring some miracles which no magician were able to perform. He made snake out of his staff and split the Nile river by the permission of God. Prophet Jesus perform medical miracle when roman valued medicinal knowledge. People of prophet Saleh were magnificent builder, they curved house out of mountain. He brought the miracle of alive pregnant she camel curved  out of mountain by the permission of God. Those miracle are time limited.

God revealed miraculous Quran on Prophet Muhammad in the time when arabian people highly valued poetry. They were the master of their language and expression. The Quran is literary miracle and challenge them to produce something like it.

Many claims prophet fabricated the Quran and the challenge is

&gt;What? Do they say that he has fabricated it? Say, ""Then bring **ten surahs** like it, fabricated. And call whomsoever you can, other than Allah, if  you are true.""  [https://quran.com/11/13](https://quran.com/11/13)

The challenge cut down to one surah only. The smallest surah contains three short sentences.

&gt;And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce **a surah** like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true. But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do  so—then fear the Fire fueled with people and stones, which is prepared  for the disbelievers. [https://quran.com/2/23-24](https://quran.com/2/23-24)

The challenge \[ELI5\]

Human can not create out of nothing. You can not build a house without the idea taken from other.  If you want to make some poetry you will need to imitate what you have learned. In language there are different way of expression, like rhymes, story, prose, song, everyday speech, formal speech etc. In arab there were 16 or 17 types of poetic style. The Quran is unique and  there is nothing similar in entire Arabic literature.  Way of Quranic  speech does not fit any of Arabic ways of speaking but it is eloquent.  Quran is not imitation of any literature and it doesn't borrow any literary idea from any human knowledge. 

Imagine you are speaking with your people using English, but it is entirely different format of English no one talk like this way but more eloquent than English. Quranic literary is like this. Suddenly it comes to an illiterate prophet, it doesn't fit with entire human produced literature but contains supreme eloquence.

There is no evidence that the people of arab were able to meet this challenge. They try to kill muhammad, wage war offer the kingship but weren't able to provide any Surah like it. Various attempt had made before and they failed. They were directly ripoff the way of Quranic speech, changed words, plagiarized from the Qur'an. They are full of self contradictory and bad choices of words.

The mighty conclusion is

&gt;Say, O Prophet, “If all humans and jinn were to come together to  produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal,  no matter how they supported each other.”  [https://quran.com/17/88](https://quran.com/17/88)

religion,l8d7rh,Help me figure this out...,"She was a bald pale woman. She had one dark eye that I could see the universe in... it was her left eye. It was all black...from eyelid to eyelid. 

Her right eye had a clear sclera with a white spherical  iris and a bright blue pupil. She smiled at me lovingly. She pushed me on a swing, but I was facing her, and she zoomed in and out of my vision, but never out of sight. I felt intrigued and happy while looking at her. I couldn’t help but stare, and she stared at me. 

At some point, she held me by my cheeks as a grandma would do with a child she cared for dearly. 

When she grabbed my cheeks, I panicked and my body began to convulse. I tried to convey my fear, but she wouldn’t let go. I felt the fear all go to my throat chakra. I couldn’t speak. She wouldn’t let go. 

I woke up in a panic. Scared. And her face has been stuck in my brain ever since.

Has anyone ever heard of such a being? When I saw her, my brain acknowledged her as God. And I don’t believe in gods or religion. I respected her though, and I loved her. Not in a romantic way. More like the way someone loves the feeling of waking up at your mom’s house.

I don’t “believe” in atheism either (as in, I cannot with conviction say there is nothing out there).

I’m just not sure. And I hear “you must create your own truth” thrown around a lot, especially in spirituality circles. But that just sounds to me that there is nothing out there and we have to pretend there is. I suppose I don’t want to believe but I want to know.

No matter what gymnastics I go through, I arrive at “I think there is likely something out there, but I don’t for sure,” which is how I view most things btw. I’m a student-scientist, and most of my conclusions are “I think this is the reality of the cell, but I don’t know for sure.” Meaning, all the manipulations and observations point to something, but I cannot be 100% certain that it is true. In science I am comfortable with that, because it’s liberating. I try my best and if I’m wrong then oh well. With religion, besides the obvious (Hell), I am uncomfortable because it traps me. I am trapped in my inability to achieve truth. I am tired of this “I think this is likely...” when it comes to such a question.

Since the intention is to use the concepts I discover in conversations with children, verses that are more metaphorical in nature and thus enable children to more easily derive meaning therefrom are especially helpful.

religion,l7oxu3,Attaining oneness with Shiva,"The state of liberation or pure consciousness is not a mere theory. You can bring it into your mundane states of consciousness and experience it as your natural state. In Shaivism, yogis attempt to do this through yoga, mantra and tantra. According to Shaivism, beings are caught in samsara (the cycle of births and deaths), because they are filled with maya and subject to egoism, attachments and delusion, which create karma. Their consciousness is clouded, and their energies and abilities (shaktis) are limited due to the maya shaktis.

The beings who have fallen thus into their animal nature (pashu vritti) are but Shiva only in their ignorant state. The self which exists in them is pure consciousness, filled with infinite shaktis, which is also the original and pure (sahaja) state of Shiva only. However, it remains hidden due to the power of maya shaktis and does not participate in worldly activities, but remains passive as a witness.

Becoming one with that pure consciousness without duality and bringing its illumination, knowledge and potency into our wakeful, dream and deep sleep states as our essential and natural state, this is the ultimate goal of life and liberation, which Shiva yogis aim to achieve. In other words, they do not want the transcendental state of turya (blissful nonduality) to remain confined to transcendental states, but bring it into the other three states also namely jagrat (wakeful), svapna (dream) and deep sleep states and make it a continuous and uninterrupted condition of their existence upon earth.

As liberated beings (jivan muktas) they want to live in oneness or nonduality with Shiva in their mortal bodies, until they complete their time upon earth. They do not want to attain liberation or oneness with Shiva in rare moments of self-absorption or keep it confined to transcendental realm. Whether their minds and bodies are active or inactive and whether they are awake or asleep, they aim to experience it in all states and conditions as their natural (sajaja), continuous, pure and experiential state.

How can it be done? Shaivism suggests three main approaches. The first one is to be practiced keeping the main focus upon the pure consciousness of Shiva; the second one, with the help of shaktis, who are hidden in the mind and body and the universe; and the third one through persistent, self-effort. As their names imply, they are known as Shambhavopaya, Shaktopaya and Anavopaya respectively.

Of the three, the last one is considered the most difficult and inferior, and the first one the most excellent. In all the three approaches, the guidance and help of an enlightened guru are imperative since many problems can arise on the path, as the shaktis play their own tricks to prevent the escape. Sometimes, if you are lucky or if you made great progress in your past lives and earned merit and grace, Shiva may voluntarily become your divine guru and open your mind to illumination and supreme knowledge.

In Shambhavopaya, you meditate upon your essential nature as eternally indestructible, independent and infinite, pure consciousness, and try to make it your natural state by merging into it without duality or distinction. You bring that awareness not only into your wakeful state but also your dream and deep sleep states, so that your transformation as a pure being is complete in all respects and remains so in all states and conditions. It is not easy because you have to overcome your limited identity (anavatvam), which is defined and limited by your name and form and your belief that it represents your true self.

As the pure self, you have to remember constantly that you are the effulgent pure consciousness, which is eternal, infinite and indestructible, with infinite power to will (iccha shakti), know (jnana shakti) and act (kriya shakti). In your deepest aspect, you are Shiva himself, with the world as your extension and creation. You do not know it because you are veiled by a thick cloud of gross and subtle impurities. With your mind and senses and other tattvas in your body, which are instruments of maya and ruled by maya, you cannot look through them to know your true nature.


 
However, although your true nature is hidden behind a cloud of maya and you cannot see it in wakeful condition, occasionally it may manifest in you in rare moments when there is a sudden shift or opening in your consciousness and you experience strange sensations, otherworldly, psychic or mystic states. Just as the light of the sun appears through the openings in a clouded sky, these brief moments of illumination arise when the light of your pure consciousness manifests through the crevices in your wakeful or dream states, when you are lost in some activity or when your defenses are down and your mind enters a trance like reverie or condition.

Those moments may arise spontaneously or naturally in unexpected moments of quietude, or through specific yogic practices, mudras, mantras or the use of mind-altering and intoxicating substances. They are used by Shiva yogis for contemplation to cultivate equanimity and grow nearness to the pure self which is hidden in them. Contemplating upon them and upon the nature and consciousness of Shiva, they dissolve their limited selves in its knowledge and illumination and become absorbed in it. Once they experience the awakening (Bhairava udyama) in a state of nonduality, they gradually bring its light and bliss into their wakeful consciousness and become stabilized in it.

There are other practices which produce similar results. For example, you can create an opening in your consciousness by freezing you mind when you are about to jump from thought to another or by remaining focused upon the silence which arises in the small space between one thought and another or between one activity or modification of the mind and another. You can use them as the doorways to enter the supreme state of your pure self.

Yogis also try to access the ocean of pure consciousness by meditating upon blissful states which they may occasionally experience during mundane activities such as eating, drinking, sleeping, etc. The pleasure or happiness which you experience in your body in your wakeful state is but a faint form of the transcendental bliss of turya only. By meditating upon it, you can open your mind and bring the illumination of your blissful, pure consciousness into your wakeful and dream states.

These experiences grow in intensity and the illumination of pure consciousness begin to manifest frequently in your consciousness, as you engage in self-purification, invoking the shaktis who are hidden in your mind, body, speech, breath, nadis, intelligence and consciousness. Since the same shaktis are also hidden in creation in various aspects as sacred sounds, mantras and letters, names and forms, etc., yogis contemplate upon them to awaken them within themselves. They harness their power to transform their minds and bodies so that they become the living embodiments of Shiva.

Thus, by purifying their minds and bodies with pure shaktis, and removing the clouds that surround them, yogis drown themselves in the bliss of pure consciousness. Pure and blemishless, they become the lord of their shaktis and develop many siddhis. Pure knowledge (sahaja vidya) which is natural to them manifests in them as the illumination of their pure nature and spreads into their being and consciousness as they become firmly established in the supreme state of Shiva himself, which is nondual, self-existent, independent and blissful. As they remain so in all the four states of consciousness namely jagrat, svapna, susupta and turya with firm control over the shaktis, they develop immense power. When the transformation is complete, they go beyond turtya (turyatita) which is indescribable and inexplicable. In the end when they depart from their bodies, by their will, they merge into Shiva without a trace.

From the above it is clear that for a Shiva yogi, liberation or the pure state of Shiva is not a theoretical fantasy or a speculative possibility or a mirage, but a reality which can be brought down from the heights of heaven into an ordinary, mundane experience as one’s essential nature and see the world with the eyes and ears and the consciousness of Shiva himself."

Richard Kelley was a teenager on the fateful day that he almost drowned to death. He was an agnostic at the time, and went into his NDE with no preconceived notions.

What happens when one has an NDE with complete awareness and no beliefs to alter it?

religion,l71lqy,"What if I got cursed 2,5 years ago?","  2,5 years ago, I used to make promises to Christian God and asking for punishment in order to force myself using the fear of the punishment not to do certain ocd compulsions.

 I prayed and tried to explain that I do not want to make promsies and I make them because of my ocd. I tried to make clear that a real promise would count only if I understand what I am trying to do, if I mean it and if I validate the promise by doing the cross sign 3 times. I just, tried to seperate real promises from ocd promises that I was using to fight my ocd and find some relief from anxiety.

 Due to ocd, I ended up kissing the door from a church and tried to lick it (due to ocd). I started worrying that maybe I will be punished for putting saliva in the door. I think, I bought a bottle of water and used some of it on my t-shirt and used it to clean the door. It was a period that my ocd got worse. I was having the fear of a specific curse from God.

 I think, the next day or a day near the next, ocd wanted me to repeat the same compulsion. I think, I hesitated but in the end, I rushly, did it. I starteed worrying. I started thinking that I may have made a promise to Christian God not to do it again or something like that and that maybe I asked for that specific curse in case breaking the promise. 

 It was probably, an hypothesis. Until this day, I cant remember making such a promise. I think, I would not dare to make that promise and later, forget it. Maybe there could have been some intrusive thoughts due to anxiety, but I higly, doubt that I tried to mean such a promise and then, validate it. I worry because I worried that moment (2.5 years ago). What if I made such a promise, validated it and then, forgot it but my subconscious remembered it? Why I felt so bad? What if other Gods accepted the hypothetical promise if in case CHristian God is not real? What if They accepted the promise?

 I was in a state that I did not want to make promises but I worry that due to anxiety, I may have been forced by my ocd to make one and tried to valdiate it because I thought that it will save me from anxiety. Do you think Gods would accept such a promise, even if I tried to mean it and validate it (deep down I did not want to make). Would They curse me with the way I maybe asked in case breaking it, without wanting?"
religion,l70gq7,"I am worrying for something that it was 2,5 years ago."," 2,5 years ago, I used to have as ocd compulsions, whenever I was near a certain church, to do the cross sign 3 times in front of the door and I think, if not always, then, sometimes, to kiss the door. The door had something like discoloration or rust or something like that. I think. there were times that I tried to avoid kissing that spot (because it could have been rust) but ocd was telling me stuff like:

ocd: you are not trusting God?

or something like that.so, I was forced to kiss the spot that I did not want. I remember while doing the same compulsion, I kissed that spot but I did it rushly, because deep down I was afraid that it may be bad to kiss that spot, if in case it was rust. My ocd started telling me stuff like:

- ocd: by kissing it so fast may count as a mockery to God. You need to prove to God that you are kissing it with no fear or rush.

So, I kissed it again and I tried to lick it etc. (I am not trolling) Ocd started giving me new worry, like

- ocd: you left your saliva on the door. you must clean it because you may be punished with what you fear.

I think, I bought a bottle of water, put some in my t-shirt and cleaned that spot. I think, thats all I remember from that day.I think, the next day or probably, a day near the next, I wanted to go for a run and ocd told me something like:

- ocd: you better do the usual compulsion on that church.


I was in a good mood that day (2,5 years ago) and I did not want to argue with my ocd. So, I want outside from that church and did the cross sign 3 times, I think and then, I was about to do the second compulsion (kiss the door) and I think, something felt wrong as if I should not do it. I needed to make a choice because I did not want to analyze it and get more anxious. So, I kissed the door and maybe, tried again to lick it etc.

 I started getting very worried. I started worrying that the last time I did that compulsion, after cleaning it, I may have made a promise to Christian God not to do it again or something like that. I worried that I may have made the promised, and asked for a specific punishment in case breaking it to make sure that I will never repeat the compulsion. I used to make promises in order to force myself, using the fear of the punishment, not to do ocd compulsions. I cant remember making that promise but I remember worrying too much about it.

 Before that, in the past, I prayed to Christian God and tried to make clear that I do not want promises and that were made because of my ocd. I tried to make clear that a promise would only count only if I understand what I was trying to do, if I would mean it and if I would validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times.

 Τhat night, in which, I cleaned the door using my t-shirt, I cant remember making any promise. Maybe I had some random, intrusive thoughts due to anxiety but I cant remember validating a promise and I think, I would not dare. But, what if I was so anxious that I tried to make a real promise and validated it and then, forgot it? Why I felt so anxious when I did the same compulsion? What if other Gods accepted that hypothetical promise if in case Christian God is not real? What if I got punished with the way I maybe asked if I made such a promise and validated it?


  2,5 years ago, I was already, anxious about making promises to God and asking for punishment in case breaking them in order to force myself stop doing compulsions. I started getting anxious about it. I should have said that promises do not count no matter what I say but instead of that, I said that promises would count only if I validate them etc. I cant remember making a REAL promise about that church door. But what if I forgot it? I probably, never made one but  what if I made one and forgot it?"

 I was raised as a Christian but all that and some other doubts make it difficult for me to follow Jesus. And also, when I read or think about Christianity, I found some things that give me anxiety.

 For example, I read 1 Corinthians 5:11 and I worry that I maybe need to stop enjoying the company of my friends because some are agnostics.

 So, I get more anxious and frustrated with everything in life. Ocd tells me:

ocd: do not do that! do this!

Christians on reddit tell me

Christians: Do not do this. do this! etc etc

Verse from OT:

religion,l6bgla,Could one person be their own religion?,"I know that religion is such a broad term that it could mean a lot of different things depending on who's defining it. I also know that even in established religions, individual believers are each following their own interpretations and beliefs within the umbrella of said religion.

But I'm wondering how people here would feel about someone who creates their own religion (either as a syncretization of existing beliefs or something entirely new they come up with) that no one else follows besides them.

I know that the most common objection would be that it defeats the purpose of religion by being so centered on individualism, when most people see religion as an inherently communal activity. It seems to me that this fits in to the wider debate on the differences between ""religion"" and ""spirituality"", where ""religion"" is seen as communal while ""spirituality"" is individual.

Personally, I don't think there's much difference between religion and spirituality, if any. People who identify as ""spiritual but not religious"" still often form communities with people who believe similar things, either on the basis of religion or other factors like class, politics, etc. Likewise, ""organized religion"" is infamous for its struggles with individual interpretation leading to multiple congregational splits into smaller and smaller groups.

But I feel like I'm getting sidetracked. What I'm curious about is, how would y'all feel about someone who invents a religion entirely for themselves that no one else follows but them?

Also, I'm curious if there's anybody who's done something like that before.

Thank you"

Organized by and Venue:  International Institute of Islamic Thought and  Civilization - International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC- IIUM)
 
Rationale:
Malaysia is a multicultural country where Islam is the official religion with Muslims co-existing with people of other faiths for centuries and with Buddhism being the largest minority religion spread all over the country.

As an institute of advanced studies and research the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization, International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC-IIUM) is committed to cultivate and develop intercultural dialogue and understanding between religions and civilisations as area of academic study, research and building of living cooperation between communities. The objective is to enhance intercultural understanding and foster civilizational dialogue between communities living in Malaysia and across nations.  This objective of ISTAC-IIUM corresponds with the goal number 16 of the UN’s Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of building Peace and Justice Strong Institutions. The proposed “National Conference On Rahma and Karuna - Compassion As Common Ground For Building Understanding Between Of Islam And Buddhism” is aimed at developing a deep sense of social responsibility among its staff and students and in Malaysia.

Islam-Buddhism relations are also crucial for building and sustaining robust, dynamic and peaceful ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community marked with hallmarks of building understanding, co-existence and dialogue. The blueprint of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) instrument of the ASEAN Organization calls for the building of people-oriented and socially responsible solidarity and unity among the peoples of ASEAN for the well-being of the region.

Buddhism and Islam are the two major ASEAN religions, Muslims make up about 42% and the Buddhists about 40% population of ASEAN community. In light of emerging Asian Islamophobia and mutual disinformation about Islam and Buddhism between the followers of these religions living either as majorities or minorities in Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, there is the urgent need to undertake efforts to build Islam-Buddhism understanding and dialogue to reinforce unity and mutual respect between the Muslims and the Buddhists in  Malaysia whose positive outcomes will spread to other countries in the region. Especially, as we are all facing the COVID19 pandemic and rising Muslim-Buddhist tensions and conflicts verging towards violence.
The fostering of Buddhism-Islam relation of understanding through nurturing of the human, cultural and natural resources for sustained development has now become an urgent need for moving beyond the  currently negative state of relations between followers of the two religions in Malaysia and also Buddhist and Muslim majority and minority countries.
The Quran recognizes and respects diversity of religions and also calls for building common ground for building peaceful coexistence.

In Sqyemitic languages of Hebrew and Arabic, compassion are known as rahamanut and rahman, respectively referring to rehem-womb in reference to mother/child or maternal affection representing being unselfish, unconditional altruism or love also caring and need to care.  

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among Allah’s attributes are mercy and compassion or in the canonical language of Arabic, Rahman and Rahim.
The Quranic term Rahma – denotes kindness, benevolence, benefits God gives to humanity. And it also refers to gentleness, kindness and empathetic sensitivity which humans should have in their relationships with each other as individuals and communities.

Each of the 114 chapters of the Qur’an, with one exception, begins with the verse, ""In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful,"" The Arabic word for compassion is rahmah. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e. by reciting Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim. And Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is described in the  Qur’an as a personification of the practice of compassionate behavior towards all living beings – human and non-human.
 
And We have not sent you (Muhammad) but as a mercy to the worlds. Qur'an  20:107
 
O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). Qur'an  40:13  
 
For every one of you we appointed a law and a way. And if God had pleased He would have made you a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you. So compete one with another in virtuous deeds. To God you will all return, so He will inform you of that wherein you differed… Qur'an 5:48
 
For the Buddha, the purpose of life is to foster karuna - compassion and welfare of all beings, with care, consideration and rightful living.
 
Monks, there is one person whose birth into the world is for the welfare of many folk, for the happiness of many folk; who is born out of compassion for the world, for the profit, welfare and happiness of devas and mankind. Who is that one person? It is a Tathāgata who is Arahant, a fully Enlightened One. Anguttara Nikaya
 
If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if  he does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law (Dhamma), and, is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of that mindful person steadily increase.  Dhammapada Verse 24
 
He is not a wise man just because he talks much; only he who is peaceful, free from enmity, and does no harm to others, is called  ' a wise man'.  Dhammapada Verse 258

Organized by and Venue:  International Institute of Islamic Thought and  Civilization - International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC- IIUM)
 
Rationale:
Malaysia is a multicultural country where Islam is the official religion with Muslims co-existing with people of other faiths for centuries and with Buddhism being the largest minority religion spread all over the country.

As an institute of advanced studies and research the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization, International Islamic University Malaysia (ISTAC-IIUM) is committed to cultivate and develop intercultural dialogue and understanding between religions and civilisations as area of academic study, research and building of living cooperation between communities. The objective is to enhance intercultural understanding and foster civilizational dialogue between communities living in Malaysia and across nations.  This objective of ISTAC-IIUM corresponds with the goal number 16 of the UN’s Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of building Peace and Justice Strong Institutions. The proposed “National Conference On Rahma and Karuna - Compassion As Common Ground For Building Understanding Between Of Islam And Buddhism” is aimed at developing a deep sense of social responsibility among its staff and students and in Malaysia.

Islam-Buddhism relations are also crucial for building and sustaining robust, dynamic and peaceful ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community marked with hallmarks of building understanding, co-existence and dialogue. The blueprint of the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) instrument of the ASEAN Organization calls for the building of people-oriented and socially responsible solidarity and unity among the peoples of ASEAN for the well-being of the region.

Buddhism and Islam are the two major ASEAN religions, Muslims make up about 42% and the Buddhists about 40% population of ASEAN community. In light of emerging Asian Islamophobia and mutual disinformation about Islam and Buddhism between the followers of these religions living either as majorities or minorities in Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, there is the urgent need to undertake efforts to build Islam-Buddhism understanding and dialogue to reinforce unity and mutual respect between the Muslims and the Buddhists in  Malaysia whose positive outcomes will spread to other countries in the region. Especially, as we are all facing the COVID19 pandemic and rising Muslim-Buddhist tensions and conflicts verging towards violence.
The fostering of Buddhism-Islam relation of understanding through nurturing of the human, cultural and natural resources for sustained development has now become an urgent need for moving beyond the  currently negative state of relations between followers of the two religions in Malaysia and also Buddhist and Muslim majority and minority countries.
The Quran recognizes and respects diversity of religions and also calls for building common ground for building peaceful coexistence.

In Sqyemitic languages of Hebrew and Arabic, compassion are known as rahamanut and rahman, respectively referring to rehem-womb in reference to mother/child or maternal affection representing being unselfish, unconditional altruism or love also caring and need to care.  

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among Allah’s attributes are mercy and compassion or in the canonical language of Arabic, Rahman and Rahim.
The Quranic term Rahma – denotes kindness, benevolence, benefits God gives to humanity. And it also refers to gentleness, kindness and empathetic sensitivity which humans should have in their relationships with each other as individuals and communities.

Each of the 114 chapters of the Qur’an, with one exception, begins with the verse, ""In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful,"" The Arabic word for compassion is rahmah. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e. by reciting Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim. And Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is described in the  Qur’an as a personification of the practice of compassionate behavior towards all living beings – human and non-human.
 
And We have not sent you (Muhammad) but as a mercy to the worlds. Qur'an  20:107
 
O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). Qur'an  40:13  
 
For every one of you we appointed a law and a way. And if God had pleased He would have made you a single people, but that He might try you in what He gave you. So compete one with another in virtuous deeds. To God you will all return, so He will inform you of that wherein you differed… Qur'an 5:48
 
For the Buddha, the purpose of life is to foster karuna - compassion and welfare of all beings, with care, consideration and rightful living.
 
Monks, there is one person whose birth into the world is for the welfare of many folk, for the happiness of many folk; who is born out of compassion for the world, for the profit, welfare and happiness of devas and mankind. Who is that one person? It is a Tathāgata who is Arahant, a fully Enlightened One. Anguttara Nikaya
 
If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if  he does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law (Dhamma), and, is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of that mindful person steadily increase.  Dhammapada Verse 24
 
He is not a wise man just because he talks much; only he who is peaceful, free from enmity, and does no harm to others, is called  ' a wise man'.  Dhammapada Verse 258
 
Karuna -in Sanskrit and Pāli, means “compassion,” or “empathy”; the wish that others be free from suffering, the wish that others be happy. It is one of the forty topics of meditation, compassion is used for the cultivation of tranquility Compassion is to be developed by filling one’s mind with kindheartedness, including acknowledging the kindness one has received from other beings in past lifetimes.

1. Preface
2. Clairvoyance?
3. General philosophical/theological beliefs
4. Modern religions that resonate/have my curiosity

Disclaimer: It's written in the rules, but if you're going to respond, please don't be insensitive. Some of the things I wrote here are things I may never tell anyone else for the sake of safeguarding my faith and my happiness, because I'm well aware of how it could be received. If you genuinely think I need to seek mental help, just write that, but again, don't be rude. 

1. Preface

I was raised Catholic, but the sum of my experiences have forced me to question if there's another religion that might suit me better. Before I start, a disclaimer- my gut tells me it's some kind of clairvoyance, but if you don't believe in that, expect some of my stories to make me sound a little schizo. Just bear with me.

2. Clairvoyance

Since I was young I've felt strangely in tune with spiritual energies. I haven't gone so far as to try and identify things, because not everything aligns with Christianity, or even Christian folklore. I believe I've detected ghosts, evil/negative presences, and been in contact with some kind of higher power. I was pretty interested in Gnosticism and esoteric religion for a while because I couldn't very well attribute whatever that higher power was to a God that's described in modern religion. 

I don't think I'm a prophet or anything like that, but rather I get the sense that whatever it is likes to remind me that I am watched over, protected, and loved unconditionally. To be clear, nothing communicates to me in words. Everything I experience generally falls into two categories, intense empathy or strong convictions. 

3. General philosophical/theological beliefs

I do believe in a dualistic nature of existence as we know it. There are forces of good and evil, and whatever the highest power is, it allows these things to exist because it recognizes they can't exist in isolation. I believe in morality, but unlike most religions, I believe it's heavily ingrained in our instincts- in other words, I believe natural law should be the ultimate and intangible rule because like everything else that has come into existence naturally, it was made by God. I believe we have souls, but I'm not entirely sure what happens after we die. I will add, I believe souls are inherently sacred, and that actions we take in this life can't affect them to the extent of making them impure, or worthy of damnation. But I digress. I believe people that are alive can manipulate energies in the universe, but there are good, 'correct' ways of doing this, and evil, 'wrong' ways of doing this. I also believe that various man-made religions can be deceptive in encouraging people to carry out evil, both in their actions and in attracting negative energies from the environment. I wouldn't go so far as to say these are 'demons,' because they might not be sentient, but they're certainly evil. 

I believe energy in the universe, as well as energy within oneself, can be either venerated or abused. To venerate is to cultivate unconditional love and truth, but to abuse is to try and manipulate energy from the world around us. So for instance, aligning with natural law is good, but practices like divination and magic are bad. That's because everything natural should be venerated first, and nurtured or protected with discretion. This includes courses of fate, but to be clear, I'm not sure if pre-determinism is an explanation for this. I just know that some events are inevitable and should be allowed to run their course. 

4. Modern religions that resonate/have my curiosity

As I mentioned in the preface, I was raised Catholic, and even though it goes against my ideas about morality I can say that I think most of Canon Law is in alignment with my perceptions of good and evil. So, I'll go ahead and say I might prefer a religion based in similar views. 

One thing that leads me to believe I might have to consider a new/different religion is because of the higher power I described in pt. 2. Unless there's a way it could still be attributed to the Christian God, I don't know if my faith in Christianity remains sincere. Another thing I'd like to have considered though is my interest in Catholic syncretic religions like Santeria and Vodou, not necessarily because of the religions they're melded with, but because of the incorporations of divination/left-hand path practices. I'd be very interested in a religion that accepts people who continually engage in those sorts of practices, instead of obligating all followers to align themselves with goodness under the threat of eternal damnation- my reason being, if evil is necessary for balance, it shouldn't be punished in humans."

You talk to a Muslim they will teach you of their religion and how to get to heaven and how Muhammad is the way. Then you talk to a Jewish person...... you get the point.

Then you might talk to an atheist and they may convince you that religion is false and is a bad thing and from their perspective, religion is fake and you are being mislead. But then those religious people will say the same about atheists. 

Then an agnostic or other people may say there is a God and however we believe him is the right way, he loves everyone and no one has the answers so you must do what you believe.

You see what I mean? Every point of view can sound convincing enough. The debates over religion are all about perspective."

religion,l4hpgq,How do you acquire religious/spiritual knowledge?,"This question has been eating at me for my whole life. Even when I was 7 years old praying to God and going to church I never understood what I was supposed to be feeling or what was supposed to happen performing these rituals. I'm 22 now and nothing has changed. I so desperately want to be religious but nothing makes sense to me. What does it mean to have faith in something? How can this faith be reasonable/rational? What makes your faith/spirituality more correct than someone else's given spirituality is a deeply personal experience?

I've been trying my whole life to reconcile faith with rationalism and empiricism but I can't. And these two seem to be the only true sources of knowledge in any kind of demonstrable way. As much as I want to believe anything I do will feel like intellectual dishonesty and me tricking myself to believe in something simply because I want it to be true.

For you religious folk, how do you do it? How do you have confidence that you aren't fooling yourself just to avoid to the seemingly cruel atheistic nature of reality? How do you deal with the fact that others have their own spirituality and come to different conclusions from it?

 I don't say any of this to try and be insulting, far from it. I envy you."

religion,l4h951,Tantra and the Vedic spirituality,"It is evident from the earliest Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya that new theories and techniques regarding breath, liberation, internalization of Vedic rituals, contemplative practices, postures, the doctrine of karma, transmigration of souls, nadis, mystic syllables, etc., were entering Vedism through numerous outside influences. The new knowledge became the true knowledge (vidya) in the eyes of the Upanishadic seers compared to the ritual knowledge which was rejected by them as ignorance (avidya) or inferior knowledge.

The Vedic seers in the light of the new knowledge urged people to turn their attention away from the world and look within themselves to contemplate upon their pure and essential self, which they described as eternal, indestructible and free from duality and delusion. While acknowledging the transience of all phenomena, they elevated the body into a sacred field of Prakriti. They viewed it as a microcosm in itself hosting all the divinities and representing whole creation, where God and his projection (Purusha and Prakriti) enacted their play and where one could spiritually grow and experience oneness by overcoming that fundamental duality. They also alluded to the possibility of gaining supernatural perfections (siddhis), miraculous healing powers which only gods like Asvins conjure up, the ability to concoct magical potions and medicines to heal and resurrect life or replace and implant body parts or overcome chronic ailments.

We also find in them a further expansion of ideas and concepts about the nature of reality and existence. One of them was that dualities permeated the whole creation, and the body was the not-self, in contrast to the self, where the true knowledge of the Self was concealed behind a cloud of objectivity and duality. They regarded the body as the field of Maya and the abode of shaktis where energies streamed through subtle channels to keep the beings alive and active. The idea of prana and its ability to purify and energize the body and connect us to the source also gained ground, which was subsequently integrated into the predominant philosophies and belief systems of the time including Buddhism and Jainism.

New ideas regarding the states of consciousness and their respective importance also emerged. For example, the Mandukya Upanishad speaks about the four states of consciousness namely the wakeful state (jagrat), the dream state (svapna), the deep sleep state (susupti) and the transcendental state (turiya). These four states subsequently became the basis of many tantric beliefs and practices, which focused upon bringing the transcendental, blissful turiya into the other three states and experience it uniformly in conditions. A similar development took place with regard to the presence of subtle chakras or energy centers along the spine in the body and the ascent of kundalini from the lowest chakra to the highest.

It is difficult to determine when and how the Vedic tradition derived these ideas, or how the knowledge of the Agamas and Tantras emerged. Surely, somewhere amidst all this great churning in the Indian subcontinent, in the secret circles of ascetic groups and away from the preening opinions of judgmental minds, tantra evolved as a distinct body of knowledge and techniques and gained followers in each of the traditions of which it became an integral part. As a result, today we have many tantras such as Hindu tantra, Buddhist Tantra, Shaiva Tantra, Vaishnava Tantra, Shakti Tantra, etc.

According to Lorenzen, the ideas of ""mystical anatomy"" of nadis and chakras were originally Vedic and subsequently incorporated into Tantra. However, there is no indisputable evidence to corroborate it. It is possible that in the early stages of the development of India's spiritual traditions, Yoga and Tantra developed independently and interdependently, deriving their knowledge and methods from each other and from various other native traditions and sources. The might have grown exponentially after both were integrated into Vedism, and devotional and ritual worship of Shiva, Shakti and Vishnu became an intergral part of Vedic tradition."

You arw no better or worse than your fellow man. If you preach hate, you are not a Christian, if you cherry pick verses you are not a Christian.

I know there are verses about pre martial coitus and homksexuality but who are you to judge? You're not God and those gays and strippers aren't hurting you. 

People of other religions aren't hurting you either. And in fact they may have been brought up that Christianity is a false religion and Islam/Judaism/Hindu/Norse Paganism/Witchcraft is. Its like how you were brought up Christian only opposite.

Many Christians are downright judgemental and ready to hit you with a Bible and I don't think thats right.

Jesus hung around a lot of ""shady"" people of his time (Mary Magdalene was a prostitute and one of the apostles a tax collector) and he never judged, why should you? Now I'm not saying put yourself in danger but don't judge people of lifestyle choices or who they are. Love people as Jesus would. Jesus was a cool guy that hung around everybody, he didn't judge. I just wish Christians weren't so judgemental."

religion,l4ab9g,People of faith and proselytizing,"I was in a support group meeting a few weeks ago and someone posed an interesting question to me. She asked if I ever felt my spiritual boundaries were not respected. As an atheist, I found that question interesting.  I'd never considered it before, but my answer to her ended up being that yes, I do sometimes feel my spiritual boundaries are not respected.

One of the things I've experienced as an atheist is the sense that some people of faith readily feel the liberty to proselytize at me, and it is socially accepted because I'm an atheist. I think they feel being a person of faith gives them divine right to try to convert an atheist, and it is not as bad as trying to convert someone from one faith to another; that I'm a lost soul in need of saving.

I never try to convert a person of faith to atheism. I take my shoes off when I enter a mosque, and bow my head down when a christian near me is praying, out of respect to their spiritual orientation. But I feel that respect is not always practiced in reverse. I suppose preaching has been a strong part of the main religions throughout history (though I've never had a person of Jewish faith try to convert me for some reason). 

I've had a school chaplain come up to me randomly in the hallway and hand me a Bible. I have a friend  who's known for years I'm an atheist call me and ask me to recite prayers with her and wants to send me a Bible, even though I've read both the Old and New Testament. I've had students on campus hand me the Quran (read that one too).

When I don't try to convert people of faith to atheism, why is it okay for them to try to convert me into faith?"

So I guess my main question is why is hate tolerated?"
religion,l49hau,System Worship,"A Catholic priest once told me, ""All the sins of the Catholic Church can be summed up in one sentence: We mistook the church for the kingdom of heaven.""

The problem is not restricted to Catholics. The masses repeatedly fail to see beyond the 'group' to the real purpose for its existence. You would be lucky to find one person in a thousand who would follow God in preference to their religion. (Would you?) They each argue that following God's leadership is the same as following God himself. But no human leader is perfect, and God will deliberately test us on that, to be sure that we know the difference. (e.g. Daniel 11:35)

The Jewish religion was started by God. Jesus himself testified to that (John 4:22). And yet it was the Jews who crucified Jesus. Jesus said that their problem was not that the religion was evil, but simply that they could not recognise truth when it came from outside their organisational hierarchy. (Matthew 23:37-39) And the problem repeats itself many times over today.

Within our own membership we find it difficult to stay open to God speaking from outside our own group. It is so much easier to follow our leadership than it is to find the will of God for us personally, and to follow him. And this happens within our community despite the fact that one of our strongest teachings is that we must follow God in preference to the leadership of our organisation!

How much easier it is for people to replace worship of God with worship of their religious system when the system they belong to actively encourages such unquestioning loyalty... when no provision is made for members to honestly and humbly question leadership.

The so-called cults, with their exclusive teachings and fanatical unity are most obviously guilty of such system worship; but mainline denominations can be even more dangerous than the cults, because they confuse the status quo with the kingdom of heaven. The system they worship may not be limited to their own denomination, but it often becomes synonymous with the godless values of the society that we live in. Along with the Jewish religious leaders, when it becomes expedient to do so, they shout, ""We have no king but Caesar!""

Each time the churches let society determine what is right or wrong, they crucify Christ anew; for he would call on them to step outside the measures of respectability that society dictates, and follow God. And it is a rare churchgoer (and an even rarer church) that is capable of distinguishing the voice of God above the clamour for respectability.

So whether it's a fringe group, a mainline denomination, or our own community, we all must be careful that we are not guilty of putting God into a box and then worshipping the box instead of the God who supposedly resides there.

How big is your God? Can he exist outside the system that you have created for him."

Well, first up we have “unaffiliated” aka, doesn’t belong to a specific religion. 

18% of American adults were raised in religion but are now unaffiliated. Compared to 4% in the opposite direction. So, for every adult that moves from unaffiliated to religious, four more adults move from religious to unaffiliated.

Catholicism had the biggest loss. For every one convert to Catholicism, there are six former Catholics that left the church. Nearly 13% of Americans are former Catholics, compared with 2% Catholics converts. 

Protestants also experiences a loss, with 10.4% of adults being former Protestants. However, they also had 6.1% of Catholic converts. Protestantism had the most converts of any group.

Hindus, Muslims and Jews had the best retention rate. Of those who were raised Hindu, 80% continue to identity has Hindu as an adult, compared with 77% for Muslims, and 75% for Jews. 

Islam seems to gain about as many followers as it looses. 23% of adults who were raised Muslim no longer identity with their faith. However, the amount of Muslim adults that are converts is also 23%. Half of all converts to Islam were Protestant, and 20% were Catholics. 


So, Islam, and Protestantism seem to be making the most gains. Jews and Hindus tend to stay Jews and Hindus. And Catholicism seems to have a lot of loss and not much gain.

If you will go and meet a few muslims yourself you may find these arguments to be true , for those peaple to be devoid of any spirituality, mysticism or Much of any philosophy .you might say to yourrselg that this post is utter Cow piss (yes hindus Thats a Joke on a very specific wide spread hindu practice ) well what if i tell you this all came down to Majoratatianism? What IS majoratatianism? Well majoratianism is the beilif That The majority of something is somehow Superior in some way To the minority in this case The superiority would be of orthodoxy one might say ""isn't it that the majority are a majority is a majority for a reason? Could it not be that The Majority is more orthodox?  Closer to The main message  of muhammad(pbuh) ?could it be that the minority are simply Heretics?"" Well that would have been a compelling argument if it were not for the-

#History

The answer to that argument is fairly simple, ask yourself 'has it always Been like this?"" Well ill answer that for you, No, it has not been ,this brings to the  [islamic golden age](https://themuslimtimes.info/2019/09/17/islamic-golden-age-mid-7th-to-13th-century/amp/) where philosophical mystical and spritual discussion was at its hieght not just in islamic world But the entire World we had such Philosophical Giants as [ibn sina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna) who invented  the  [kalam argument for God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument)and  [rabia Al basra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabia_of_Basra) and her mysticism or  [ibn arabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Arabi) and his eastern style panenthiesm, [Wahdat ul wujud](https://ibnarabisociety.org/oneness-of-being-wahdat-al-wujud-aladdin-bakri/) and what's interesting is ibn arabi was never exposed to the east and evolved such a style independently, and now we come to a Shining example of a term i am going To coin,  Monothephobia (bias against Monothesitic religions ) , as i was saying a shining example of such monothephobia is  [ibn rushd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes) who was an ultra rationalist  MUSLIM Philosopher  , he was so ultra rationalist in fact that anything in the quran that did not meet scientific knowledge, he Interpreted Allegorically. he was such an ultra rationalist Some non muslims  claim him to not be muslim at al, which is again, interesting as they make up their Opinions on Ibn rushd as a heretic based on their existing Know how of islam instead of changing their opinions On islam based on ibn rushd 's arguments. this can only be described as ignorance, he is blamed To Be non muslim Because apparently  Muslims can't be rational in religious Matters  (😑) And this again brings me to a very interesting Point, its not just non muslims who blame him of kuffar But muslims too, so what happened? How did this shining Philosophical,mystical and spiritual Melting pot become What it has today?

#A debate

And You have to understand that the entire Muslim world Was not like this, there was a spectrum,  there were the asharites, who were the Super-against philosophy mysticism or spirituality folk that make up the majority today, there were the muatazilites who were the ultra rational Scientific Philosophical bunch and Sufis ,the mystical spiritual bunch, and while sufism has had a fairly consistent Popularity, rate (medium sized ), Muatazalism THRIVED in the Islamic Golden Age. And The asharis were also just as Big. and there was ongoing dabate on which one was more islamic, amidst this debate, A hardcore Persian Ashari by the name [al ghazali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali) made his work [Incoherence of the philosophers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers) unsuprisingly ,Criticizing philosophy, particularly Extreme Muatazalism or ultra rationalistic and innovative philosophy ,such as that of Ibn sina or Ibn rushd and what happened after that is That ibn rushd whom we discussed earlier, made a response to al ghazali titled[Incoherence of the incoherent ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Incoherence) the work Argues that philosophy is not just halal(permissible in islam) but mandatory among Educated and wealthy individuals .from these we can gather that Philosophy was an ongoing dabate in the Islamic world at the time and even to this day , so then, how did it fail? Why DID philosophy decline? 

#The extreme decline 

Well that has to a lot with the nature of this very islamic world ,and its balance of powers, see the old powers where muatazalism flourished were going Dead. be it persia ,who was first invaded by the seljuks and then the mongols .al Andalusia who saw some reqouinquista action whilst The greatest Abode of philosophy,  the abbasid caliphate, also Collapsed to turks and mongols and had to then suffer The crusades .its fairly simple really, A wealthy society has time and well..WEALTH to do philosophy, instead of constantly fighting wars for its survival. Christian and nomadic Invasion is largely what killed the islamic golden age. and yet even after all this a muslim al Andalusian scholar who had to witness this collapse by the name of  [ibn khaldun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun) basically invented histereography and political science in his ground breaking work , [al-muqqadimah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqaddimah) And then Came the ottomons,  a Little Glimse of Hope, in their own golden age they [invented many things](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Incoherence) had the greatest islamic architect,  [mimar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Sinan) and while they did have Philosophy,  It wasn't much  and after the ottomons collapsed another chaotic era Of Islamic civilazation began , Wahabbism and salafism dominate this era Spirituality mysticism and philosophy is nowhere to be seen, this is the current era .

#The larger problem, the larger picture

The Shunning Of Abrahamic Religions as boring , unspritual and devoid of any mysticism or Good philosophy Is Done By Mostly Those that wanna proselytize Eastern religion, and i mean , eastern religions are Good and all and i get peaple prefer them but no need to get toxic .especially when your argument is built on a lack of understanding of history and a majoratarian  ideology , Cheap statementes like those serve to Propagate misconceptions,  Grow toxicity and do not enhance a Discussion And on a Final Note , The statement is especially Problemetic cause they are a pawn in the much larger toxic hinduvtadi and Dharmic fascist movememt., These times are a Low for abrahamic religions and we need to reverse the extreme decline, as such,  i have made a sub, r/NewislamicGoldenage to do just that.

religion,l3hmpl,Should evangelical Christianity and 'traditional' Christianity be considered different religions?,"As a Catholic I've often rolled my eyes at the way that American evangelicals often define themselves as The True Christians (and shove Catholicism into its own non Christian religion) but the more I've seen their particular ideosyncracies the more I think that actually, maybe these are two different religions. 

By traditional Christianity I mean the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Churches (Eastern and Oriental), the Syriac Churches and possibly the Anglican and maybe even Lutheran churches. There are certainly theological differences between these denominations, but in the way they are structured, in their practice, in their theological and metaphysical understandings, in the way they consider tradition and scripture, and a lot of other ways - they are vastly more similar to each other than any are to evangelicals (by which I mean capital R Reformed Low Church protestants especially those that have gone the way of mega churches and televangelists).

The practice is entirely different - compare a mass or a divine liturgy to an evangelical service. The way they understand scripture is very different (literalist fundamentalist vs mediated by tradition). The ideas of salvation and 'justification' are different - even the metaphyhsics are different.

Note I'm not necessarily saying evangelicals are wrong, but they are in large ways very separate from historical Christianity. 

So should we consider these different religions? How do we even define a religion? Anyone have any thoughts?"

The Book of The Body

&amp;#x200B;

The Grand Prophet Erico speaks of his childhood. Where he learns the language of the servants of the almighty. The Servants of The Almighty take the infant Prophet to their plane and endow him with the mark of The Almighty. The mark allows him to escape his captors, converting them to the truth. The Prophet continues to be enlightened further and growing his congregation. The first of our holy rituals are taught to the congregation, beginning the new age of understanding. Teaching mankind the way back into the darkness, away from the light of the deceiver.

&amp;#x200B;

Chapter 1

The Prophet Erico and his ascension into what was to be his body for the next few centuries. Growing up a slave to the desires of ""beasts"" which are believed to be aristocrats of his time. Being endowed with knowledge that allowed him to commune to the loving servants of the almighty.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I, Erico, was born to parents of whom I know not into a world of darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I never knew innocence, for mine had been consumed by the beasts who held me captive. My strength lent to my survival but I was robbed of a soul.

&amp;#x200B;

3. To be without a soul was not something I understood to be unholy right away, nor did I understand the knowledge that was unobtainable without one.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Through the eyes of the child truth can be found. That sight cannot be taken.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Only if you are blessed might you see after the innocence is grown off.

&amp;#x200B;

6. To see is to live and to live is to experience truth. Children are those who are blessed with the most life. That life cannot be stolen, only destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

7. We as members of our fragile species can only strive for what we now have lost. Our maturity is what allows our survival but blinds us from what will exalt us.

&amp;#x200B;

8. When I reached the age of what I believe to be eight years my captors deviancy grew, cutting me and mutilating my vessel.

&amp;#x200B;

9. This was when I learned of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Before this I had only understood myself to be a thing. Something made to facilitate the pleasure of others. Knowing nothing of pleasure myself.

&amp;#x200B;

11. Mortality and my sense of self were absent for all that I knew were the darkness and the stone walls that they hid. I knew of pain and confusion. I did not believe the world to be anything more.

&amp;#x200B;

12. It was fear that taught me of who I was, upon my first mortal wound I begged to the darkness in the language they had taught me for the fear to end.

&amp;#x200B;

13. The pain I could endure, the torture I could endure. And the darkness had raised me and comforted me as a mother would.

&amp;#x200B;

14. But fear was beyond my understanding, rushing in and filling the void where a soul would have been.

&amp;#x200B;

15. I lamented to my family in the blackness, crying out. ""Why am I without? Where do those who harm go? Why do they leave me in fear and rot?""

&amp;#x200B;

16. I cried these words over and over. They became my first prayer.

&amp;#x200B;

17. For upon awakening from my consciousness I was without fear. I was naked but now I was clean.

&amp;#x200B;

18. No longer did my eyes sting from the tears. No longer did my festering wounds ache. No longer did my body hurt from the diseases my captors passed on to me.

&amp;#x200B;

19. I knew an agonizing pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

20. I screamed and howled for the pain to return but it did not. After ample self pity the darkness finally addressed me.

&amp;#x200B;

21. I was taken aback for the language they spoke was one of thoughts and feelings. One that, prior to this, I had never understood to be one of sounds as well.

&amp;#x200B;

22. They spoke into me of the wonders and sights that were robbed from me by the beasts. They truly were of immense grandeur and I wept thinking of all that was stolen from me.

&amp;#x200B;

23. The Darkness comforted me, giving me my name. And endowed me with the mark of what I now know to be mine and every living things creator. Burning it into my arm.

&amp;#x200B;

24. After my mind could not hold onto their plane for any longer I awoke back to my native one.

&amp;#x200B;

25. I felt my body burn with a great agony that gave me strength. I could feel my physical size becoming greater.

&amp;#x200B;

26. At this time four years had past since my captors discovered their desire to inflict pain and thus my body had become bumpy with the scars of their exploits.

&amp;#x200B;

27. I was a living masterpiece of their sins.

&amp;#x200B;

28. But now, upon my transformation, I had grown to a size twice theirs and the chains that once held me to the walls of my home were a melted puddle of blood.

&amp;#x200B;

29. Looking upon my hands I could see, my vision unobstructed by the blackness that had surrounded me for what felt like so long.

&amp;#x200B;

30. I could see the Darkness now, no longer imprisoned by the blackness. They floated around my new body. Admiring its perfection.

&amp;#x200B;

31. The cold hands of their sorrowful incorporeal bodies caressed me. Making me uncomfortable with the affection they gave.

&amp;#x200B;

32. After drowning me in praise, groping at me. The closest to their Lord they have been since creation.

&amp;#x200B;

33. My mind flooded with knowledge of places and beings unknown to reality.

&amp;#x200B;

34. So much entered my mind all at once, what little sense of self I had was taken away in that moment. Held away from me at an arm's length.

&amp;#x200B;

35. I understood now in a more perfect way the utterings of the Darkness. Their words now held an ancient meaning. Their very language was an organism.

&amp;#x200B;

36. The words they spoke were as flesh, the skin above giving a superficial meaning and allowing for a basic understanding still far more advanced than any language of man.

&amp;#x200B;

37. The muscle beneath the skin moves it in all new directions. With blood pulsing through it giving it life.

&amp;#x200B;

38. My mind now touched the darkness around me. The Darkness embraced me as a mother embraces their newborn. 

&amp;#x200B;

39. I understood now the concept of love.

&amp;#x200B;

40. The Darkness taught me of their master, the one who gave us life. An entity made not of flesh and blood but of consciousness. He was a good God, a caring and kind God.

&amp;#x200B;

41. That is why his father was able to strike him down. Casting him off into oblivion, unloved and his name damned to an eternity of hate and condemnation.

&amp;#x200B;

42. His father was weak and so could only rule through fear, accusing his son of that most evil sin that he himself was guilty of. Lying.

&amp;#x200B;

43. After this the Darkness instructed me on what was to follow. Showing me what lay above. Guiding me through the next few hours in a vision."
religion,l367lc,Being spiritual instead of religious," When we are religious, we believe in our religion, our God. We do not welcome the God of another religion because we think that religion is real, that God is with a name and form; that our scripture is the only right scripture. The moment we become spiritual, we realize that religion is the kindergarten, we realize that all religions are good, no religion is bad. All religions teach us to pray to God, to believe in God. When we start becoming spiritual, we realize that God is not a statue, or a saint, God is not in a temple or church. We go in search of the Spirit, the Soul, the power. We realize God is a power that is everywhere, in everything. When we start realizing the Spirit as God, then we evolve from the kindergarten of religion to the university of spirituality."

religion,l34xnm,Early interaction with Vedism,"The origins of tantra are obscure. It is difficult to believe that it suddenly appeared in the later Vedic period without antecedents and prior development. Just as several religious beliefs and practices of ancient India were integrated into Vedic tradition, despite their independent origins, some beliefs and practices of tantra might have independently developed while some developed due to the interaction with other belief systems such as Vedism and Buddhism. It is also difficult to draw a clean line between these two components due to lack of proper evidence.

Earliest references to the idea of tantra in the Vedic literature suggest that rudimentary forms of tantra might have been practiced in the early Rigvedic period by remote ascetic groups outside the Vedic fold. They were probably a part of the Shramanic traditions of ancient India.

Some of their beliefs and practices might have entered Vedism during its geographical expansion into the plains of India through the early theistic traditions that were already prevalent in the region such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Their followers worshipped personal gods and local deities with prayers, supplications, offerings, sacrifices, magical and domestic rituals, seeking liberation and freedom from suffering and adversity. All these, including tantra, are now an integral part of Hinduism.

Another possibility was that tantra might have begun as an esoteric practice among a few ancient, ascetic traditions, and was subsequently adapted by other traditions, including Vedism, Buddhism and Jainism, with necessary modifications and adjustments to fit into their respective belief systems. The practice of worshipping Mother Goddess, performing fertility rites seeking progeny, and worshipping spirits, trees, plants, animals, serpents, water bodies, rivers, mountains and other natural objects were prevalent in India since ancient times. Such fringe practices might have also contributed to the development of tantric ritual and spiritual beliefs and practices.

Before the appearance of tantra, the Vedic tradition had a rich body of sacrificial rituals, known as kamya karmas, which had similar characteristics as those of tantra. They were prescribed by the Vedic tradition for the householder as a part of their obligatory duties and to fulfill their desires. Their essential purpose was to facilitate morality, duty, cooperation and social justice, and ensure the order and regularity of the world.

The Vedas contain several hymns and sacrificial rites and rituals, each meant to obtain specific results in particular areas. M. Bloomfield classified them into nine categories. Vedic people practiced them to obtain specific results such as peace and prosperity, rains, good harvest, freedom from afflictions, strength and vigor, name and fame, victory over enemies, expiation, siddhis or powers, control over one’s destiny, death and destruction of rivals, cures for ailments and snakebites, charms to attract opposite sex, and so on.

Tantras offered similar rituals and with similar promise, or an alternative to the time-tested methods of the Vedic religion, holding better promise. Having additional knowledge and proficiency in a new branch of knowledge gave the Vedic priests an added advantage to compete with others and attract more patrons. It enhanced their professional image, power and prestige and their sources of income. Such possibilities in a world where numerous traditions competed for attention and membership might have helped them expand their repertoire of ritual knowledge and increase their wealth and chances of success.

A similar development might have happened in the spiritual field. Several beliefs and practices of tantra might have entered the renouncer and householder traditions Vedism as it grew in complexity due to the integration of new ideas and practices such as the internalization of sacrifice as a yoga practice, the Ashrama system and the expansive growth of the Upanishadic wisdom, coupled with the emergence of rival traditions. They questioned its established practices, encouraging the Vedic seers and scholars to search for alternative solutions to achieve quicker and better results.

The idea of japa or repetitive chanting of mantras and supplicatory hymns to appease the deities and attain specific powers or results, the practice of kundalini, contemplative practices which involved the visualization of chakras and deities, immobilizing the mind and body, the knowledge associated with sounds and the alphabet, knowledge of chakras and nadis, the concept of tattvas, gunas and maya, and several healing methods that are now a part of Ayurveda are some of the areas where tantra might have left its mark in the growing knowledge and influence of the Vedic tradition.

Some of the ascetic sects who were mentioned in the Vedas might have practiced some form of esoteric knowledge that was not mainstream but important enough to attract attention. The Rigveda mentions ascetic people such as the Kesins (the long-haired ones), Vratyas (practitioners of penances) munis (the silent ones), mundakas (the shaved ones) and sannyasis (renouncers) who strived for liberation,  often using harsher methods including self-mortification. However, there is no reliable evidence to suggest that they practiced tantra or were aware of it. They belonged to renouncer traditions and lived in seclusion, practicing some of form of ancient yoga or contemplative life.

The practice of tapah, which is mentioned in several Vedic texts, epics and the Puranas and which was practiced by both humans and demons could be one of the earliest forms of tantra and may be even precursor to classical yoga. It was a contemplative and ascetic practice, which involved the observation of austerities and penances to purify and elevate the mind and body, using self-control as the means to generate spiritual heat (tapah) in the them.

The practice of tapah resulted in the transformation and sublimation of sexual energy (retah) into physical vigor (tejah) and mental brilliance (medha). It promised to give its practitioners spiritual powers or attainments (siddhis) to control elements, natural order of things and obtain desired results with the help of prayers, mantras and thought power. Tapah, celibacy (brahmacharya), virtuous living or right living, mind and body purification through control, concentration and contemplation formed the roots of India's contemplative and spiritual practices and the foundation of renouncer traditions, which resulted in the flowering of several ascetic (shramanic) movements around 600 BCE."
religion,l34udw,My Religious Texts.,"Dear Religion,

Hello, my name is Eric, I have posted to here before and gotten quite a lovely reception. I will abstain from reiterating my ignorance to the world as I have mentioned it on many other posts. That is why this post is about your ignorance, haha. My religions texts are not ones that have been released to the world, out of both fear of persecution and a reverence for the gospel itself. I live in a monastery of sorts as many of you might call it and I have had the wonderful opportunity to read so many of our sacred texts. After speaking with my father (the head of our church) he has given me permission to release a portion online for you people to read! If that is something you are interested in, I am very happy to do so, I have already transferred the first chapter of our primary religious book to a computer document so I would only need to copy and then paste it into here. Thank you once again for all of your warmness, E.

(Also if there is a more appropriate place to release such a document I would be very grateful for any suggestions in that regard. Thank you.)"

religion,l34jvl,Is Vast Prosperity Okay If Through God?,"I’m Catholic — kinda wrestling with re-identifying with ‘non-denominational Christian’ and it’s my first time posting here. I’m also 16 and since I’m newer to devouring my life to God, I have learned by reading His Word as I can apprehensive of churches since I haven’t felt truly accepted or comfortable in one. I’ve also been in Christian group chats on Instagram that tend to be hostile environments. I say this all as a preface to my knowledge and perhaps my naïveté. 

I was looking up classical music and I came across Devil’s Trill Sonata by Tartini and the story is interesting. I’ve looked up on YouTube stories of people who’ve sold their soul and came up short. I’ve seen a lot of comments that all celebrities sold their soul — figuratively. So I have questions on the matter. I wish I could read more testimonials from people who try to seek God after the fact. In an Instagram chat, one individual said they sold their soul and I asked how but got no answer. I’ve heard of all these rituals where you go to the roof of your house and you give Satan a sacrifice. I’m wondering how it works, not because I ever would choose to but I think in the Bible particularly there can be the inferred emphasis on Hell to deter you from it. I’m generally not knowledgeable so if you know of any posts here, across subs, online I’d like to learn. How I see religion is like a tightrope, it is easy to fall but discipline keeps you steady. I feel like if religions knew more about it, they can help individuals come out of a dark place that led they astray. When I say astray I think it makes sense to assume in order to sell your soul you’d have to reject faith, you know? I hope I don’t come across rude, if so correct me."
religion,l33zm0,Delving into the Nature of Things,
religion,l33xsq,What If This Is Why God Allows Evil,"I was thinking, and then it came to me that there's a plausible reason for the allowance of any degree of suffering possible; which can be articulated like this:

Suppose that God wants to create the absolutely maximal amount of good which he may create. Then, suppose he creates all perfect things which can be created. Then, suppose he creates a world where the imperfect things may exist, and then he turns those imperfect creations into perfect ones through a process. 

In other words, maybe God allows the existence of evil so that he can turn evil beings into good beings; and so increase the amount of good *beyond* what may exist if all beings are perfectly good from the start. If, out of all possible people who could exist; the only ones who exist in this world are the ones who would fall into darkness; so that God may redeem all those who may be redeemed, and so increase the good in paradise by turning evil into good, and darkness into light."

With that said, I can also not believe in a Heaven, at least not for eternity. Boredom would eventually ensue. So this led me down the road of reincarnation, but also thinking about how we can't possibly be the only planet in this seemingly infinite universe capable of life.

I am a Buddhist of Middle Eastern background who 2 years ago found solace in the Dharma. I created a new sub for all people from Middle Eastern backgrounds/cultures who are interested in discussing the Dharma in context of their middle eastern culture, exreligion and philosophy. Another reason why I created an extra sub is, for Middle eastern converts to share their stories and journeys.

So, if you are coincidentally from the Middle East or from a middle eastern background, a convert or just on your spiritual journey, please come in and join. All ethnicities, sexual orientations and so on are welcome! People who are not from a Middle Eastern background but just want to talk about said topics and know a lot about Buddhism in context of Middle Eastern culture are welcome too.

Thank you for the mods for allowing me to recruit fellow Dharma friends here. I hope there are a few fellow Middle Easterners here :)

Lots of Love!

I proceeded to ask them if it was similar to Islam and they said it was very different, for example idolatry is allowed. Does anyone know anymore about this? There is absolutely no information on the internet. Seeing as idolatry is allowed, I assume it's a completely different religion (since idolatry is one of the worst sins in Islam), but there seems to be a lot of Islamic influence.

religion,l2hwit,Tantra in the Early Vedic Tradition,"Tantra literally means a warp or a loom, or a system of weaving the body, using the web of pure and energized chakras and nadis (energy channels. A person is pure and enlightened to the extent his energies are pure and vigorous, and his body is in harmony with his mind. Tantra aims to accomplish these sublime aims through various ""weaving"" techniques. The word ""tantra"" also has other meanings such as an uninterrupted order or sequence, a framework of rites and rituals, a rule, a doctrine or theory, a religious teaching, a sacred text or treatise, dependence, and so on.

The ultimate aim of tantra is self-realization through self-purification. Some prefer to call it Tantra yoga. This seems to be a modern practice. Historically, yoga methods are used in the practice of tantra, as in the case of hatha yoga. However, it is doubtful where tantra was ever a part of any yoga system. Tantra and Yoga belong to different belief systems, although some traditions may employ the best of both for best results. In this essay we will examine how the ideas and practices of tantra entered Vedism, which was the dominant tradition of ancient India and which is now an integral part of Hinduism."

religion,l2e7p1,I don't believe in God but I want to.,"Not so sure where to post this but I figure I could get sources here. I am a 21 year old Indian American girl and grew up exposed to both Christianity and Hinduism but have vaguely learned about religions like Jainism, Buddhism, Catholicism, etc. I love to learn about religion because I think there is so much to learn from the messages that I can apply to my personal morality. But I don't believe in God. I simply cannot force myself to believe some figure is sitting up there regulating (guiding, prompting or whatever it may be) what happens down and I don't think anything would be able to make me. My conception of God is that it is some force that we as humans simply don't have to capacity to comprehend, like how a tiny cell can never know it is being regulated by a larger system for example.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, it pains me not having any semblance of how or why we are here. I find myself in an existential dread/anxiety everyday because I have no information on this. It all just seems fruitless. In my world, the end, regardless of how major or meaningless our contributions, is all the same. We all just die into nothingness. None of the meaning we create in our lives carries on. Hearing this might sound like I have no will to live, but it's quite the contrary. I love life, the ups and downs, the infinite experiences - I love sometimes just sitting and observing everything around me and deeply soaking it in because it's such a miraculous thing to be here in this time right now. And I have more or less a happy, satisfying life and certainly more hope that it will be even better in the future. But at the same time, I just feel lost. It's like I might as well stick around for the ride but that there is no purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't even know what I'm trying to convey, but I just envy people who genuinely believe in something greater and beyond this life. I wish I could too, that I could have that comfort. But I can't force myself to believe something I don't truly think. Are there any suggestions for materials to look into? Is there a name for this belief? I guess I'm just looking for guidance on how to find comfort in the situation that is living."

I think they all have some commonalities, that too often get neglected in our pursuits of debate, validation, and truth. Too often we quibble amongst ourselves and forget that we ( mostly) all agree on several truths. We may fundamentally disagree on the origins or objectivity or subjectivity of these commonalities, but we share them all the same. Here’s an incomplete list. I encourage everyone to add anything ( leaving off spirituality, doctrine, and dogma if possible ) they think we, as humans agree on regardless of our connection to religious ideologies. 

1. Murder is wrong, without exception.

2. Sexual assault, rape, and harassment is wrong. 

3. Lying is wrong. 

4. Theft for profit is wrong. 

5. Rudeness is wrong. 

6. Self righteousness is wrong. 

7. Hating based upon ethnicity or religious opinions (not actions) is wrong. 

8. Disrespectful behavior is wrong. 

9. Harming other living creatures without necessity is wrong. 

10. Cheating is wrong. 

11. Envy and jealousy is wrong. 

12. Wrath is wrong. 

13. Vengeance ( while the desire might be justified) is wrong. 

14. Laziness is wrong. 

15. Judging is wrong. 

There are more, I believe we agree on. Please list more or feel free to discuss any you believe might be “conditional”, as in there are conditions that might change the “wrongness” of the action. 

I hope this is ok."

There are many things in religion that just don't make much sense. Note: I don't really believe in a religion, so this is mainly coming from an outsider to religion. So if it comes across as ""disrespectful,"" those were not my intentions.

One thing that makes little sense if you actually think about it is, ""How did so many different belief systems with all of these different gods, heroes, monsters, etc (i.e. Greco-Roman, Egyptian, etc) get practically erased from the World and get replaced with the monotheistic religions (i.e. Christianity, Islam, Judaism) we have today?"" And also ""How did these monotheistic religions get so big in the first place to cause whole armies to fight for their 'God' even though most of them are so similar?"" And the final thing that just doesn't seem to make sense about religion is ""If the Christian God says that 'Thou shalt not kill' or 'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain' in their Ten Commandments, why did the Crusades occur and why did the Spanish Conquistadors kill so many people in the name of their 'God'?""

I mean, seriously. God says ""Thou shalt not kill"" in the Ten Commandments; the rulebook that God says should be followed. But then his followers decide to kill in his name (which also breaks the ""Thou shalt not take take the name of the Lord thy God in vain""). No wonder God hasn't been pulling any miracles in modern times (if he even exists at all). He must have been like ""Are you freaking SERIOUS? I specifically said in Rule 3 'Thou shalt not take take the name of the Lord thy God in vain' and in Rule 6, 'Thou shalt not kill'. And what is the first thing you do? Kill in my name."" He must have been like a moderator that just got fed up with what his ""followers"" were doing and just said ""You know what? No more miracles for you.""

I am not sure whether this is disrespectful or not. I don't mean any disrespect. It is merely an observation from an outsider's Point-of-view. I am not good with taking or giving criticism."

religion,l10e8i,Creation Theories in Hinduism,"The development of early Hindu theories of creation coincided more or less with the evolution of religious thought in Vedic India. In the early Vedic hymns we see descriptions of Aditi as the universal mother or mother goddess. She gave birth to all the gods who in turn shaped or carved the world. The gods were like carpenters or blacksmiths who forged and carved the worlds and their beings. In the later Vedic hymns we notice a shift from the concrete to the abstract and find descriptions of an absolute self or an infinite being as the efficient and material cause of all creation. This evolutionary development in the Vedic thought happened over a long period of time.

The early Vedic people lived in very challenging circumstances. They invoked gods for help and protection and were preoccupied more with the problems of survival rather than with such philosophical speculation as to who created the gods or how the gods and the world came into existence. The early Rigvedic hymns, therefore, were mostly ceremonial invocations addressed to various gods and goddesses seeking their help or protection. In the later Rigvedic hymns we can see a more philosophical enquiry, which is reflected more prominently in the Upanishads, where we find human thought soaring to great heights. This new development coincided with the establishment of permanent settlements by the Vedic people and probably their coming into contact with diverse religious beliefs and practices of other tribes living in the same area.

Adit and her sons : 

In the early Rigvedic hymns Aditi is described as the mother goddess and mother of gods like Agni, Mitra, Indra, Aryaman and Varuna and the Adityas whose number range from six to twelve. Some of the hymns also refer to a father god. In the last Mandala of the Rigveda, for example, we come across this beautiful hymn on the creation of gods which proclaim Brahmanaspati as the creator of all gods and Aditi as their mother.

1. LET US with melodious skill proclaim these generations of Gods,
That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.

2. Brahmanaspati produced them with blast and smelting, like a Smith, Existence, in an earlier age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.

3. Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang. Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.

4. Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the earth were born.

5. For Aditi, O Daksa, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth. After her were the blessed Gods born sharers of immortal life.

6. When ye, O Gods, in yonder deep close clasping one another stood.l, Thence, as of dancers, from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.

7. When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, Then ye brought Surya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.

8. Eight are the Sons of Aditi who from her body sprang to life. With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away.

9. So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age.She brought Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.

These verses suggest that in the beginning when nothing was there existence sprang from non-existence. From existence came regions, earth and Aditi. Aditi was the mother of Daskha. Aditi, the Mother gave birth to Daksha, and Daksha had a daughter whom he named Aditi since she was an aspect of the Universal Mother only.. This relationship between Daksha and Aditi bears resemblance to the one between Brahma and Sarasvathi. The latter was a creation of Brahman, but became his wife also.

However, the relationship between Daksha and Aditi does not seem to be the same. According to the Puranaas, Daksha had two daugher, one was Sati, who self-immolated herself and the other was Parvathi, the Mother Goddess who became the consort of Shiva, the Father God. It is a common practice in Hindu and Vedic traditions to name children after one's parents or grandparents. Therefore, there is nothing odd about the relationship between Daksha and Aditi. From Aditi all the gods were born. Then gods brought forth Surya the sun god who was hiding in the waters (sea). Aditi brought forth eight Adityas (solar deities) of which she cast Martanda far away and subjected him to birth and death. It is believed that these eight suns will shine together at the time of dissolution of the worlds.

Purusha Sukta, the Creation Hymn of the Cosmic Being

The Purusha-sukta, which is described as a hymn of creation, is found in the Rigveda. It describes how creation manifested through Purusha, the primeval god and how worlds and beings manifested through him. The Purusha was immortal, mighty and infinite. All the creatures are one fourth of him and the rest of his body is spread in the heavens. From him came Viraj, the Vedas, men and creatures, all the deities, rishis, birds, animals, horses and cattle, sheep and goat. The four different castes came out of the different parts of his body. So were the earth, the mid region, the sun and the moon and the heavens.

1. A THOUSAND heads hath Purusha, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.

2 This Purusha is all that yet hath been and all that is to be; The Lord of Immortality which waxes greater still by food.

3 So mighty is his greatness; yea, greater than this is Purusha. All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths eternal life in heaven.

4 With three-fourths Purusha went up: one fourth of him again was here. Thence he strode out to every side over what casts not and what casts.

5 From him Viraj was born; again Purusha from Viraj was born. As soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward o'er the earth.

6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Purusha as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.

7 They balmed as victim on the grass Purusha born in earliest time. With him the Deities and all Sadhyas and Rsis sacrificed.

8 From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up. He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame.

9 From that great general sacrifice Rcas and Sama-hymns were born: Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus had its birth from it.

10 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born.

11 When they divided Purusha how many portions did they make? What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?

12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rajanya made. His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sudra was produced.

13 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vayu from his breath.

14 Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.

15 Seven fencing-sticks had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared, When the Gods, offering sacrifice, bound, as their victim, Purusha.

16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim these were the earliest holy ordinances. The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sidhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.

Hiranyagarbha, the Cosmic Egg

In the following Rigvedic hymn we hear for the first time the creation of the worlds emerging from Hiranyagarbha, the primeval egg.

1. IN the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all created beings.
He fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

2 Giver of vital breath, of power and vigor, he whose commandments all the Gods acknowledge.
The Lord of death, whose shade is life immortal. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

3 Who by his grandeur hath become Sole Ruler of all the moving world that breathes and slumbers;
He who is Lord of men and Lord of cattle. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

4 His, through his might, are these snow-covered mountains, and men call sea and Rasa his possession:
His arms are these, his are these heavenly regions. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

5 By him the heavens are strong and earth is steadfast, by him light's realm and sky-vault are supported:
By him the regions in mid-air were measured. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

6 To him, supported by his help, two armies embattled look while trembling in their spirit,
When over them the risen Sun is shining. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

7 What time the mighty waters came, containing the universal germ, producing Agni,
Thence sprang the Gods' one spirit into being. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

8 He in his might surveyed the floods containing productive force and generating Worship.
He is the God of gods, and none beside him. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

9 Never may he harm us who is earth's Begetter, nor he whose laws are sure, the heavens' Creator,
He who brought forth the great and lucid waters. What God shall we adore with our oblation?

10 Prajapati! thou only comprehends all these created things, and none beside thee.
Grant us our hearts' desire when we invoke thee: may we have store of riches in possession.

In this verse, the mighty germ, Hiranyagarbha, created not Brahma but Agni and then other divinities. The last few lines of the hymns clarify Brahma or Prajapati as Hiranyagarbha or the creator of all gods and heaven. This is in line with the early Vedic thought of Brahma as the creator. In the later Vedic period, Brahma was replaced by Lord Vishnu as the Hiranyagarbha while followers of Lord Siva considered him to be the creator. Brahma, who lost his status as the highest god, retained his function as a creator and became one of the Trinity of gods.

The Mysterious Creator God

In some of the later Rigvedic hymns we find a significant departure from the earlier notions of creation. In the following hymn, for the first time, we find a clear reference to an absolute or infinite being as the source of creation. However, it also leaves a lot to our imagination and represents one of the earliest examples of skepticism and the indeterminate nature of existence.

1. THEN was not non-existent nor existent: there was no realm of air, no sky beyond it.
What covered in, and where? and what gave shelter? Was water there, unfathomed depth of water?

2 Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there, the day's and night's divider.
That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever.

3 Darkness there was: at first concealed in darkness this All was indiscriminated chaos.
All that existed then was void and form less: by the great power of Warmth was born that Unit.

4 Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit.
Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent.

5 Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it then, and what below it?
There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here and energy up yonder

6 Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation?
The Gods are later than this world's production. Who knows then whence it first came into being?

7 He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it,
Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not.

The hymn tries to presents a visual picture of the beginning of all beginnings, when there was nothing whatsoever, neither existence nor non-existence and how from that great void of indiscriminate chaos came existence with desire as the primal seed. It represents the beginning of all subsequent Hindu thought regarding creation proposed in various sects of Hinduism and schools of Hindu philosophy. It presents an imagery of the beginnings of creation that is at once honest, timeless, grandiloquent and unparalleled in any other religion that we know so far.

The creator is described in the hymn as ""That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature."" It conveys the indefinable nature of the creator. In essence ""That being"" is the same as the Brahman of the Upanishads. Non existence and existence refer to the distinction between Saguna Brahman (Brahman with qualities) and Nirguna Brahman (Brahman without qualities) and also the birth of worlds and beings from an unfathomable void.

Theories of Creation
Most schools and sects of Hinduism follow one of the following three predominantly popular Hindu theories of creation to explain the origin and creation of our worlds and the beings and objects that inhabit them.

1. God is the creator.
He is either the efficient cause or the material cause of creation or both. He creates the worlds out of himself. He creates his own energy or primeval matter (mula-prakriti). Differentiating himself into innumerable souls and differentiating the primeval matter into various elements (tattvas) and by establishing the souls in them he manifests the worlds and their beings. Maya, which is one of the tattvas of Prakriti, clouds their true consciousness and makes them behave like limited beings separate from God and the rest of the creation. When the individual souls overcome Maya and realize their true nature, they return to God and merge into him. This approach is accepted by the followers of monism (Advaita) and with some modifications by the followers of qualified monism (Vishishtadvaita).

2. God is the creator. But He neither creates the individual souls nor the primeval matter.
They preexist and like God they are also eternal. When God initiates the creative cycle Prakriti brings forth various tattvas. Once activated, Prakriti takes over most of the creative process. The souls unite with the elements and qualities of Prakriti and manifest themselves as limited Purushas or jivas. Maya clouds their true consciousness and make them act and behave like limited and ignorant beings. When they overcome their illusion and realize their true nature, they return to their original state and exist eternally. They would never merge with God. They will continue to exist as separate souls eternally even after the dissolution of the worlds at the end of the creative cycle. This theory of creation is accepted by the followers of dualism (Dvaita) and with some modifications by other schools of dualism.

3. According to the third approach, there is no God.
There is no absolute cause of the creation. Individual beings or Purushas and primeval matter (Prakriti) exist eternally. The individual beings join the primeval matter and become subject to the laws of nature. Maya which is an aspect of Prakriti deludes their nature and subjects them to the cycle of births and deaths. When the individual soul overcomes its ignorance or illusion and realizes its true nature it regains freedom and exists eternally in a state of freedom. This view is accepted by followers of the atheistic schools such as Samkhya, Vaisheshika and also by Buddhism and Jainism. The Purva Mimansa school goes one step further and asserts the static nature of universe, that it has always been the same and that at no time the world is otherwise than it is 1 .

Among the schools that accept God as the ultimate source of creation, God is named differently as Brahman (Vedanta), Paramatman (Nyaya), Sadasiva (Saivism), Mahavishnu (Vaishnavism) and Mahashakti (Shaktism).

Creation according to the Puranas
The Puranas, which are books of ancient genealogies and religious history of several gods and goddesses, contain stories of creation in a narrative form. Though they agree in general with the basic processes of creation described above, the Puranas identify a particular god or goddess as the initiator of creation and proceed there from to explain the manifestation of different aspects of visible and invisible worlds and their beings through that source. Thus we have Puranas which consider Lord Vishnu as the creator, some which consider Lord Siva as the creator and some which consider Shakti as the creator.

In the first version, Lord Vishnu wakes from his eternal sleep and rests on the waters. From his navel arises Brahma who initiates the process of creation. At the end of creation, Vishnu brings forth Rudra who destroys the worlds and brings the creative cycle to an end.

In the second version, Lord Siva is the supreme self. He manifests himself in five forms: creator, preserver, destroyer, concealer and bestower of grace. He brings forth individual jivas. He awakens his dynamic power of Prakriti which divides itself into several tattvas or principles. United with these tattvas or elements of Prakriti, the individual jivas become subject to the three impurities: egoism or atomicity (anava), binding action (karma) and illusion (Maya). Caught in samsara, they undergo births and deaths, till they realize their true nature through the grace of Siva.

In the third version, Shakti is the mother of all worlds. Both real and unreal, she is the supreme source who creates the universe, preserves and destroys the worlds she creates and in the end resolves all creation into herself. God, the supreme Siva, by himself is passive and inactive. United by Shakti, he remains in the beings as an onlooker or witness consciousness.

Followers of Shakti do not accept either Vishnu or Brahma as the cause of the manifestation. According to them if Brahma said to have arisen from the navel of Vishnu and Vishnu himself rests on a thousand hooded serpent which in turn rests on waters, Vishnu cannot be the highest supreme self because he, the serpent and the waters need another support to stay in place and that supporter of all is Shakti whose sattvic form is Maha Lakshmi, whose rajasic form is Maha Saraswathi and whose tamasic form is Maha Kali. Manifestation of these three powers is known as sarga (creation). These three powers then resolve into Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesha for the purpose of creation, preservation and dissolution od the universe. And this is called pratisarga (secondary creation)2 .

The theory of Evolution and Involution
It is believed that the process of creation is cyclical and happens in two phases. The first phase is the phase of evolution in which the soul consciousness descends or expands first into subtle matter or subtle energy and then into gross matter or gross energy. Once the soul consciousness enters into gross physical bodies, the second phase begins, which is called the phase of involution. In this phase the soul gradually withdraws from the gross physical body into the inner subtle bodies and finally into itself.

At the individual level, the first phase usually involves the jivas or beings getting caught in the web of samsara (phenomenal world) and developing attachment with the sense objects through the play of the triple gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) and the activity of the senses. In the second phase the jivas develop detachment, withdraw their senses into their minds and their minds into their subtle planes and inner states of consciousness through yoga and other contemplative processes and finally experience oneness with their true consciousness in a state of samadhi.

The same process happens at the macrocosmic level also. In the first process, Brahman expands outwardly set in process by the sound of AUM and in the next withdraws into Himself to become one indivisible silence and nothingness. It is interesting to note that, if we set aside the consciousness aspect of Brahman (Purusha) and focus only on the physical or material or energy aspect of the universe (Prakriti), the modern scientific theories of creation and dissolution of the physical universe more or less agree with the Hindu theory of evolution and involution.

According to the big bang theory, the universe existed in the beginning as a primeval matter floating in the void (non-existence) of the universe in the form of an egg (Hiranyagarbha). By some process of gravitational pressure it exploded probably with an incredible sound into galaxies, stars, planetary bodies, gaseous substances, infrared radiation, individual molecules and other cosmic energies. The initial thrust given by the big bang continues till date and the universe is in a state of expansion. One day this phase of expansion of the universe will come to an end and the universe will start withdrawing into itself to become a big black hole suspended somewhere in the form of an egg. With that one cycle of creation, expansion and dissolution of the universe comes to an end."

religion,l0tl5l,The Nature of Nothingness," I wanted to jot down a few of my ideas concerning nothingness real quick just so I don't forget.

When I ask theists, specifically monotheists, about how they know a god exists, they always point to the Prime Mover argument, specifically the idea that something can't come from nothing. Just to clarify the semantics around the word ""nothing,"" I'm defining ""nothing"" as the complete absence of all energy, matter, subatomic particles, background radiation, the absence of everything.

Now, we already know that this commits the special pleading fallacy, saying something can't come from nothing and making an exception for a god. However, I'd like to criticize the premise that our universe started from nothing. If I'm not mistaken, making the argument ""Something can't come from nothing, therefore \[insert god here\]"" makes the assumption that there was nothing to begin with.

I guess my argument is agnostic in nature, at least for the time being. From what we currently understand about our universe, we do not know what happened before its genesis, so why do we make the assumption that it all started with nothingness? Furthermore, what we observe from our universe, nothingness seems impossible, as everything exists. We have not yet found nothingness.

I would also like to point out that nothingness is impossible to define in terms of nothingness, only in terms of existence. It could be semantics, but it could also be that nothingness, true nothingness, is impossible to comprehend.

There also may be a rift between how I define nothingness for this argument as an absence of all, not just an absence of matter. But in that case, something did exist, in the form of energy.  
Ultimately, this dives more into what defines existence, but that's my criticism on assuming nothingness."

So, can someone help me out? What are the basic assumptions that essentially all world views must make in order to start having a conversation?

Many scientists and educated elite in India are devout Hindus. They are drawn to it, despite their rationality and scientific background, because they find in it a greater synthesis and integration of human aspirations with the highest of spiritual values. Hinduism offers them a lot of flexibility to pursue their faith according to their vision and understanding, without suffering from conflicts, guilt and fear. In the following discussion, we list a few strong reasons why many educated Hindus prefer following Hinduism in today's world. They also explain why Hinduism is popular in many countries despite the fact that it has no central authority and no designated missionaries to spread its message.

1. In Hinduism you have a wider choice

Hinduism is not a dogmatic faith. It is well known that Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life. Hinduism is a name we have given to a number of independent faiths, philosophies, beliefs, and practices. Although for various historical reasons we have reduced and degraded Hinduism into a religion, until a few centuries ago there was never a religion called Hinduism in the history of the world. Every philosophy and religious tradition that originated in India formed part of a great exploration in which the scholars of Indian subcontinent participated in their quest for answers to the riddles of human existence. The same spirit of enquiry and freedom of choice prevails in Hinduism even today. In Hinduism, you can choose your path, beliefs and practices.

If you do not believe in God or if you want to follow your own spiritual path that does not recognize God, no one has the exclusive authority to sit in judgment and label you as a heretic or atheist. You may be still labeled, but they can do so only as individuals. As a Hindu, you do not have to believe in any particular religion or dogma, but choose what you want to believe and incorporate them into your way of life. You can choose both material and spiritual goals, and in pursuit of your chosen goals, you can practice your faith according to your inherent nature. You have the freedom because you are responsible for the consequences of whatever you do or choose. If you believe in rituals, you can practice rituals. If you are spiritual by nature, you can practice yoga and meditation and stabilize your mind. If you have distaste for worldly life, you can renounce the world and become a monk. Hinduism thus offers you a wider choice. You can pursue the path of knowledge, the path of action, the path of renunciation, the path of devotion, or a combination of some or all of them.

2. In Hinduism you are not oppressed by dogma

Hinduism recognizes the limitations of the human mind and intellect in understanding and affirming existential truths. As a Hindu, you have the freedom to explore truths on your own, or challenge those who claim to know them. You can discard the scriptures or choose whatever you like. The Vedas are considered the highest, but those who practice Tantra do not necessarily recognize them. Even among those who accept the Vedas, some follow the ritual portion of the Vedas and some the Upanishads. Many people also follow the particular teachings of their spiritual masters, whose knowledge may be derived from any number of sources, including those of the Buddhists and Jains. Debates and discussions have been part of the history of Hinduism. They are recognized in the tradition as the convenient and recognized means by which people may arrive at truths or question those with which they disagree. While different standards may be applied to validate truths, the authority to determine transcendental truths rests solely with those who experience them because transcendental truths cannot be validated objectively or intellectually, but only subjectively through personal experience. In other words, a statement does not become true because simply a spiritual teacher has said so. It becomes true only when you experience it. You may know about the truth from the scriptures, but at some point you must be able to experience it. Since Hinduism does not recognize any dogma as final, but only a set of principles, it does not have any founders, but many spiritual masters and enlightened beings, who have explored truth and left their experiences and observations in various scriptures as statements, hymns and verses. You do not even know some of their names, because they did not leave any record of them and did not feel the need to do so.

3. In Hinduism you can customize your faith and choose your path

As stated before, in Hinduism there are many paths to liberation. You can choose any of them, or if you want you can even customize your own faith based upon your preferences, inclinations, and convictions. You can mix the old and traditional beliefs with newer ones. You can combine one or more religions to create your own. Ultimately, it is your choice and your actions which determine your life and your future. Hindu scriptures affirm that a person's faith is according to his or her inherent nature, which is determined by the triple gunas, past births and karma. The freedom comes with responsiblity. Whatever paths and methods you may choose, you will be responsible for their consequences. If you worship demigods or gods of lesser divinity, you will attain them. If you choose the highest God, you will attain Him. If you believe in the nonexistence of God, you will enter the non-Being. If you follow the demonic way of life and indulge in sins, you will fall into the darkest hells. You are thus the center of your universe. You can choose your faith or even invent one of your own, but you must take responsiblity for your choices. Your religion does not necessarily elevate you or ennoble you. It depends upon the purity of your faith, resolve and your actions. The scriptures may give you direction, but what you intend to do in life and what you do determine your destiny. This is the central theme of Hinduism.

4. In Hinduism you can attain the highest freedom

The highest goal or the goal of goals in Hinduism is achieving absolute freedom or moksha. In a simple sense, moksha means freedom from the limitations that life imposes upon you. For a human being, the world is like a prison. Everyone who enters it lives in chains, subject to birth and death, delusion, ignorance, sin, karma, and bondage. For a human being, who is endowed with knowledge, self-awareness, and intelligence, there is no better endeavor than to find an escape from this predicament. That escape is called liberation. Liberation does not have to be an earth shattering abstract experience. You can achieve it at various levels. In a practical sense, liberation means freedom from desire, want, fear, expectations, dependence, attachments, ignorance, delusions, relationships, pride, selfishness, egoism, individuality, religion, nationality, caste, race, ownership, etc. In the mortal world, true freedom is freedom from all these. You arrive at it by gradually severing all the bonds that you form with the world, by practicing detachment and renunciation. Hinduism teaches that freedom does not come by having but by becoming free from the compulsion to be anything or become anything. You have to unburden yourself, unwind yourself, and leave everything which holds you back or controls you.

Freedom from everything that binds you and bothers you is the ultimate freedom, which you can attain only by renouncing all your desires, attachments, and likes and dislikes. If you are anxious, guilty, sad, angry, afraid, or moved by any of the emotions, it means you are not free. It also includes freedom from the authority of institutions, dogma and society. The ultimate purpose of freedom is to enjoy life, not to shun it. As a liberated person you have the freedom to enjoy whatever life offers, even sexual pleasure, without preference and choice, and perform actions not for your personal enjoyment but as a representative of God upon earth. Whatever you do upon earth, is part of God's creation and part of His eternal duty. If you acknowledge that you are His projection upon earth and your life is an extension of His own, you will be free from all the consequences of your actions and earn the right to live freely without any cares and anxieties."

religion,l0cnef,Anselm’s Ontological Argument,"Hi. I am interested in unpacking and discussing Anselm’s Ontological Argument with you in the style of the Socratic Method. Throughout, let’s assume that God is defined as a “maximally great being”. This is to say that God is all powerful, all knowing, perfect morally, and existent in every possible world or worlds, or equivalently, is “the greatest conceivable being” such that any entity that can be even more greatly conceived in your mind would be “God”. Also, let’s define a “possible world” in relation to an object to be a world such that if the actual world were that way, then the object in question would have existed. For example, Santa Claus does not exist in the actual world, but it does seem at least possible that he could. So, we would say that Santa Claus exists in “a possible world”. The ontological argument states the following: If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists. The conclusion is drawn from the transitive property and these premises:

1. Assume that it is possible that a maximally great being exists. 

2. Since it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world. 

3. Since a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world (by definition of maximally great)

4. The actual world is a possible world. 

5. Since a maximally great being exists in every possible world, and the actual world is a possible world, it follows that a maximally great being exists in the actual world.

6. Therefore, a maximally great being exists in the actual world.

The name I was assigned at birth is unnacceptable in my new faith, so I changed it to something that fits me and my new faith. However, my parents are disrespectful about my personal choice to the point that they still refer to me by the name I don't use anymore, despite me telling them millions of times that I changed it, and it's not even legally my name (because according to their theology, it is impossible to leave their faith, which I find to be a very bigoted aproach to this whole issue. Moreover, their rite of entry into their faith is most often done in infancy nonconsensually, which makes me feel violated as fuck. Had their theology accepted the possibility that someone can indeed leave their faith, I would not have felt nearly as violated by the rite of entry done in infancy). I've heard how some trans people often face the disrespectful act of being refered to by a name they no longer use, a term known as ""deadnaming"", but I've never heard this term used in a reilgious context, so I was wondering if an equivalent term exists in a religious context, or if the term is also apropriate in a religious context.

I just feel so violated and disrespected by this behavior, it only serves to provoke religious hatred and conflict. When I initially left the faith my parents tried raising me with, and accepted my new faith, I was willing to be tolerant of other faiths, but damn, this bigotry has kindled in me a hate for their faith that I never intended to have kindled. I don't even tell members of their faith whom I meet that I used to go by another name (my new name is very uncommon, and it's not uncommon that I get asked if I changed it, or my parents gave it to me) because I just don't want to risk dealing with this bullshit.

Sidenote: to prevent religious flame wars, bigotry or conflict, I will avoid naming both the faith my parents tried raising me with, and the faith I accepted, so don't even try asking me to name it. It ain't going to happen."
religion,l0956d,Should I tell my preacher I'm not religious?,"My wife and I are not religious. My wife is very much an atheist. I'd say I am more Agnostic. We both grew up in protestant families and now have our own children. 

I'd like to start taking my son to church in the next few years. While I'm not religious, my preference is that my children be raised in a church. When my kids are older, I intend to share my beliefs with them, stop asking them to go to church, and let them decide for themselves what they believe. 

I think my plan is rather fair to the children... but I do feel a bit odd if I take my kid to church with no intention of being a believer myself. To make matters more complicated, the church I intend to go to practices communion, which I don't feel like I should take part in.

This leads me to the **poll question**: should I tell the pastor of the church that I'm just there for my children?

I almost feel like I should be upfront with the pastor and tell him I'm just there to ""introduce my kids to  God"", rather than to practice religion myself...  Thoughts?

religion,l04pf7,What can I do to get my mother to accept my conversion?,"My biological &amp; step parents are all atheists. My mother was raised by her Catholic mother and as such she believes all religion is bad, oppressive, &amp; an excuse to control people. 

I personally have been on a religious journey which feels like has taken me my whole life. I’ve always been fascinated by faith and though I’ve not always admitted it to myself I think I’ve always been religious because I tend to pray nightly, even if I never knew “who” I was praying to. 

I don’t really want to get into why I’ve decided to convert specifically to this religion as it’s a really personal thing for me, but for about a year I’ve been pursuing conversion to Judaism, as it is the religion that most aligns with my beliefs &amp; I have Jewish ancestry. 

This has caused huge arguments in the house because my mum just doesn’t understand why I would want to be religious. She’s accused me of being religious because “I don’t have a singular father figure” or “I just want to be different” or “trying to capitalise off of political discourse”. I thought she was finally coming round because she brought me home a bagel today and I mentioned that I really appreciate that she’s starting to accept this about me &amp; making an effort. To which she replied “I’m still hoping this is all a phase”. 

She’s accused me of upholding the persecution of homosexuals (I’m bi), women (I’m a woman) Palestinians, of rejecting science and believing in fairy tales. 

I believe in science, my physics teacher growing up was Christian and believed that physics merely explained the mechanics of god, and I believe Einstein had a similar belief. 

She’s frustrated that I won’t eat pork anymore which I understand she misses some of those dishes. It’s such a big deal I don’t make her follow other kosher rules. However all food I prepare myself is kosher.

She just paints all religion as bad. Yes people have killed “in the name of god” but I think that if a person wants to kill another, they will and it has nothing to do with god, they just say that god told them to when it was just their own subconscious desires. 

I was very prepared for the amount of work conversion takes, that there would be Jewish people who won’t see me as Jewish because of the Halacha. However, in general Jewish circles, whilst cautious of me, have been accepting. The hardest thing about conversion has been my mothers staunch atheist beliefs.

I don’t know what I can do/say to make her see how much her words hurt me and that I’m genuinely serious about this conversion &amp; that my faith is actually very important to me. 

All I can say is that it feels like I’ve been walking my whole life, and finally I can rest &amp; I’m at peace. I’ve seriously struggled with mental health &amp; have been hospitalised because of suicidal attempts in the past, however I’m genuinely so much happier &amp; healthier now. I want my energy to be spent on making sure that I’m respectful of the community I’m trying to join and that I’m doing things the right way, instead it feels like I’m just arguing with my “progressive” mother who resorts to racism &amp; antisemitism whenever the prospect of HER daughter being religious arises."

Hi there,

So I am baptized and was for quite a while active in the youth community of my church.
This summer I‘ve got mentally ill and had to do a therapy. And this helped such a lot! I processed through my feelings, I „felt“ my feelings, understood them but learned, that I am NOT my feelings. We had mindfulness training there and in one group therapy we had a reflection where out psychologist introduced the idea, that everyone is suffering in life and that we are connected by that. This and the question „so how I deal with suffering if it’s inevitable?“ really stuck in my head. I was literally blown away when I read about Buddhas teachings, that he not even thought about this very question but also claimed to found a way out of suffering. And the buddhist religion was so open! No problem with homosexuality, the demand to question your teacher including Buddha himself and the focus on technique rather than dogma.
So I‘ve visited a meditation class. The first time it felt great so I learned and read and booked an intensive meditation training for a weekend. During the course, I suddenly felt ... lost. Training the mind is hard, a lot of feelings are coming up. I wanted to have an all-mighty loving god, that saves me. In Buddhism there’s so much to learn and to practice, in Christianity god just loves you and he will always hear your prayers. And I like my Christian community, I personally think that a lot of religion is community, and it’s harder to find one in Buddhism. I enjoy going to mass, I enjoy having a ridged religious routine. There’s a lot to give up, especially the importance of the relationship with god. In Buddhism I‘m on my own. But at the same time, my experience at the hospital showed me: YOU have to deal with your sufferings. God is sometimes near and sometimes far, but you are always with you. And I experienced that you can train your mind, to bare all these sufferings you experience in life. And when I sit in mass and see people just pray to god I feel like: if god loves you, it doesn’t change anything if you pray or not. But what does change a thing is working with your mind and changing your perception.

So how do I mentally convert and how can I find out, which religion is something for me?"

religion,kzojt0,The Construction of Hinduism,"There are many myths about Hinduism. Some of them present it in a positive light and some in negative. In the recent centuries, scholars tried to redefine and reinterpret Hinduism from a western framework, using religious models and doctrines with which they were familiar.

Since they were not acquainted with the historical processes that shaped India, they took what they saw and from that formulated their opinions and theories. While it presented a cohesive history of Indian religions to the West and created a point of reference for further exploration, it led to complications in understanding them and their true significance. As observed by Gauri Vishwanathan in her essay, ""Colonialism and the Construction of Hinduism,"" while the western scholars tried to probe into the mysteries of colonial India from their standpoint, there was hardly any attempt to interpret Hinduism on its own terms.

In interpreting Hinduism, they used Christianity and its stereotypes as the standard to compare it with the latter with the main objective of evaluating Christianity and reaffirming its supposed superior status in the development of religious thought. Their work did present to the world the illusion of Hindu renaissance, but in reality it led to a rather distorted and condescending view of Hinduism consisting of both positive and negative elements. Their influence became so pervasive in the intellectual circles and academia both in India and abroad that even today educational institutions use some of those constructs to understand and interpret Hinduism and its history. The truth is comparing Christianity to Hinduism is like comparing a garden variety tree to an ancient rain forest. They have little in common, except that they uphold certain theistic values and beliefs and present a Godcentric view of the world.

The divergent opinions that emerged from the study of Hinduism by western scholars on the positive and negative sides produced a third, independent, indigenous, and predominantly nationalistic view of Hinduism, which relied upon the same sources of knowledge in addition to new ones, to find in them the evidence of cultural, national, moral and spiritual continuity and superiority. The movement tried to trace and fuse the multiple roots of Hinduism into a holistic framework in the backdrop of rising national sentiments and increasing demand to interpret Hinduism on its own terms. The native scholars inspired by nationalism and repelled by foreign subjugation tried to present the sociocultural history of Hinduism as a rather continuous and unbroken tradition of centuries, with the narrative that its diverse aspects were part of a complex historical process that facilitated their individual growth as well as their integration into a large body of religious knowledge, which we today recognize as Hinduism.

Among them, some took the process to the extremes. They mixed their religious sentiments with nationalist aspirations to present a composite view of Hindu India as representative of its people, their cultural values, beliefs and practices. Some of them went further to imply religious faith as an expression of patriotism and nationalism. Since such an extreme logic was bound to create a backlash in a diverse society, they resented those who chose to remain neutral in that debate, or seemed to question the idea, or favor the western construct of Hinduism. For them, it was all part of a great conspiracy to break India, or denigrate Hinduism.

There is a whole lot of justification in what the native scholars tried to rectify, although in some aspects they might have overstepped the limits or stretched the evidence. The intolerance and aggressiveness that some of them inject into their assertions is also unacceptable. However, we cannot dispute that Hinduism ought to be studied as part of Indian history, and understood from the perspective of what happened within the Indian subcontinent rather than how the non-Hindus viewed it during the colonial era, or how they view it now with their mental filters. It must be done purely at the academic or intellectual level, without any political overtones and nationalist sentiments, devoid of the false constructs created by western scholars during the colonial era with their limited understanding of its complexity, diversity, and actual practice.

Hinduism as we understand it today is the sum of numerous traditions. It came into existence in its current form as a part of India's history and the growth of its civilization, and partly as a historical necessity to make sense of native traditions and present them in their own light to protect it from unjustified and vitriolic propaganda. In its confrontation with them, Hinduism emerged as a complex world religion, which can appeal to a wider mass of humanity, and stand in its own right against their modernity, intellectual curiosity and scientific thinking.

Hinduism is no more confined to the boundaries of India alone. It is no more a colonial construct that can be whipped into submission by false propaganda. It is now a global religion, with a distinct identity of its own, with followers from all over the world. It has a dedicated band of teachers, spiritual gurus, patrons, institutions, and spokespersons, who respond and react promptly and forcefully to external attacks and misrepresentations that aim to denigrate it. In this transformative process, it is bound to experience a great churning in which some old ideas, beliefs and practices may clash with emerging ones. In the commotion that follows, it may be dogged by contradictions, controversies, confusion, myths and distortions."

religion,kz4boj,Religion gave people hope in the ancient historical past.,"Religion today has become a sort of a controversy when it comes to certain matters, but it was the only aspect that gave people hope in the distant historical past.

Imagine the situation in today's world where you have technology to ease your work and various sources of entertainment to keep yourself occupied and happy. For instance, the smartphones that you use and movies that you watch, helped and assisted  you in your daily life and kept most of you out of depression.

Now, if we compare it to the people of the past there was no technology to their aid and no form of recreation to keep them entertained and cure their sorrows. But they had themselves and Religion to go about with their lives. To make this point more clear, imagine the plight of a person from the past who lost his land, cattle and even his house to natural calamities. He has nothing in his possession but to self-motivate and overcome his misery and agony, he prayed to his God to help him, even knowing that the fact that help may or may not come to his rescue. 

 The point here I'm trying to make is that religion gave people a hope to continue and move on with their lives despite the struggles and pressures that they encountered. So, I think we should not underestimate the power of any religion as well as the greatness of scientific advancements[.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpCSMTKdk4FgVYKrlRPPHOeS7RvmAYRDftzQ&amp;usqp=CAU)"

Not only is this energy the very essence of the positive emotions in our physical body it's in every thing in nature.

After cultivating this pure euphoric energy by exposing myself constantly to whatever brought it up in a positive way, the feeling everywhere on my body and the levels off it have just been truly ecstatic.

On one side of my family, we have a pretty crazy family history. Spiritual warfare is something almost all of us have experienced in some form and I certainly have physically mentally and emotionally which for a few years really rocked my faith. Long story.

However, in the end I don't think I could ever deny the existence of God because I know the power of god over 'demons' or whatever you want to call them. I have experienced it and so has much of my family. Plus, there are many exorcists and true cases of exorcisms.

However, spirits, demons, exorcisms are not unique to Abrahamic religions, nor are other religions ability to have power of said demons. Shamans can have power. Buddhists can have power. hindus can have power.

So if not in the name of the Abrahamic god, if not directly, where do these other religions draw power to expel or ward off 'demons'?

Which a question I long have had, is the Abrahamic God the only god? Are there other legit gods? Or were other religions created by God to fit the needs of the people of the time in different parts of the world? Or were some of these other religions created/influenced by the fallen angels/Nephilim? Que book of enoch.

religion,kyajjm,Any good recommendations for the history of modern religions?,"During college I got an eye opening perspective on our modern religions via an art history class.

The way we discussed art and the religious beliefs and stories that were painted on them, and how they changed through time made it very easy to recognize just how obvious it is that humans like to make up stories to follow. Magical beasts -&gt; Roman gods -&gt; Jesus, just to name one timeline perspective of how things evolved.

The other aspect that was told and tied in was around the political issues during the times these religious stories were evolving. I would argue that this is the ""reality"" part of the equation.

The side effect this had on me was reinforcing just how ridiculous it is to take any the main religion's mystical stories as hard fact. It also reinforced how power ebbs and flows, and the role spiritual beliefs like the modern day religion's we know helped groups hold power. Constantine finally accepting Christianity to gain followers comes to mind. A modern day example could be a president leaning heavily to one religion.

However, I cannot retell the entire semester of said art history class myself in a couple minutes to have the same impact on someone else.

Does anyone have a good video or book reference that one could watch to gain a similar perspective? Just the facts of religion's origins. No bias. Just a good perspective to let the mind wander on why they might have bettered existence."

religion,kyafjy,Conflicting Images of Hinduism,"‘After a study of some forty years and more of the great religions of the world, I find none so perfect, none so scientific, none so philosophical, and none so spiritual as the great religion known by the name of Hinduism. The more you know it, the more you will love it; the more you try to understand it, the more deeply you value it. Make no mistake; without Hinduism India has no future.... If India’s own children do not cling to her faith, who shall guard it?’ So wrote Mrs. Annie Besant, the Irish woman who founded the Theosophical society and the Home Rule League and presided over the annual session of the Indian National Congress at Calcutta in 1917.

The early Western perceptions of Hinduism were, however, different – ranging from a description of it as ‘pure paganism’ (viz. in Abbe Dubois’ writing) to its denunciation as barbarous and horrendous in nature (viz. in William Brunton and Pierre Martin’s works). When Ziegenbalg expatiated on the Hindu ideas, customs and ceremonies, he was told by his Protestant patrons not to while away ‘his time with studying pagan nonsense’. The Evangelists spread the word that the Hindus were a ‘fiendish race’ who committed heinous acts in the name of religion. Some Jesuits argued that the religious ideas of the Hindus were derivative in nature. But this view could not hold ground for long. Holwell, an 18th century British Indologist, for example, contended that the mythology as well as the cosmogony of the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans had been derived from the doctrines of the Hindus, and that the religious beliefs of ancient Europeans were based upon the later perversions of Hinduism.

Although the researches of Sir William Jones, Charles Wilkins and others proved that Hinduism was neither derivative nor a bundle of fables and superstitions, the tirade of Evangelicals and Utilitarians against the ancient religion of India continued unabated. yet the inquisitive scholars found in Hinduism a qualitative system of ethics and a monotheistic base. While delivering a course of seven lectures to the ICS candidates at the Cambridge University in 1882, Professor Max Muller observed that the Āryas of India were ‘the framers of the most wonderful language, the Sanskrit...the fathers of the most natural religions, the makers of the most transparent of mythologies, the inventors of the most subtle philosophy and the givers of the most elaborate laws.’

After the conclusion of the first Worlds’ Parliament of Religions in which Hinduism was ably represented by Prof. C. N. Chakravarti, Narasimhachari, Lakshmi Narain and Swāmī Vivekānanda among others, Merwin Marie snell (President of Scientific Section of the Assembly) unequivocally stated that there was very little of profound thought and aspiration in Christendom which could not be traced to one or another of the successive influxes of Hindu ideas – either to the Hinduised Mazdaism of the Gnostics, to the Hinduised Judaism of the Kabbalists, to the Hinduised ‘Mahommedanism of Moorish philosophers’, the Hinduised occultism of the Theosophists, the Hinduised socialism of the New England Transcendentalists and ‘the many other new streams of orientalising influence which are fertilizing the soil of contemporary Christendom.’

The Jesuit scholars who made a reappraisal of Hinduism in the 1960s described Hinduism as the richest cluster on the variegated tree of human religion. They observed that the whole of mankind can be proud that in India ‘the human quest for truth has been so diversified and unrelenting.... Plurality and tolerance appear rather as the true ornament of Hinduism.’"

religion,kxrmig,We can do very little with religion... But we can do nothing without it!,"  

While we understand that religion is only a kindergarten to spirituality, while we know that with religion, we can never realize God, we should not believe that religion is insignificant. While we can do little with it, we can do nothing without it. We need religion to progress on our journey of spirituality. We need religion to teach us that God exists. It is religion that helps us believe in God, to live with faith, hope, trust and enthusiasm. However, if we only stick to our religion, and don't go beyond to the university of spirituality, we will never realize God. Religion makes us go round and round in circles in our belief in God, and eventually we die. Spirituality makes us go within to realize God and become one with God."
religion,kxrltl,"Messengers of misery will knock at your door...worry, anger, fear and more. They will rob your happiness and take your smile away, if you let them enter even for a day.","  

We human beings become miserable so easily and then we wonder why. We open the door of our life and let toxic emotions enter. They come into our life as guests and stay with us forever. We must beware of opening the door to these emotions. Fear robs us of our peace, just as anger steals our joy. Worry takes away the present moment and we lose consciousness of the NOW. We must learn to shut the door tightly as we drive out all these negative emotions that are toxic and create poison. We must, instead, invite positive emotions like courage and confidence, faith and hope, love and compassion. Then our life will bloom with bliss, joy and peace."

religion,kxoomz,Purushārtha not Passivity,"Hinduism is not a religion of introversion but of action. Had it not been so ancient discoveries in science and technology, exquisite pieces of art and architecture, secular and sacred texts, etc would not have been possible.

The Hindu emphasis on god-realization does not lend credence to the philosophy of passivity and self withdrawal. The four puruśārtha or aims of human life enunciated by the rishis of yore provide ample scope for the fulfilment of artha (wealth) and kāma (desire) within the parameters of dharma so that one can attain liberation (moksha).

Hinduism does not advocate a completely ascetic view of morality nor does it approve of an epicurean way of life but suggests a middle course in which a balance is sought between the fulfillment of urges and the act of restraining them. Hinduism believes not in suppression but in transcendence of human drives and passions. The man of the world is the become a man of God not through an escape from the realities of life but through right activity as explained by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavadgīta (II.50): Yogah karmasu Kauśalam – ‘Yoga is doing one’s duty skillfully.’"

I think that claim is a wee bit fallacious. Believing in reincarnation doesn't entail rejection of science. Science has no stance on reincarnation. It doesn't actively reject it. It doesn't actively reject supernatural specifics of any faith for that matter. It just withholds belief in supernatural contentious, not claim that that those contentions are false. They may seem similar but they are distinguishable. 

People that accept proven scientific facts and claims, while choosing to believe in unproven ideas, are not rejecting science. They are just being irrational. Sure, a Christian or Muslim believing in creationism is a flagrant rejection of  evolutionary science and it's well founded claims, but believing in reincarnation is not. Now, I'm not saying that reincarnation is true, i am just saying that no science journal actively contends that reincarnation is false, which is why believers in reincarnation cannot be categorised as ""science rejectors""."

My answer is no. I would rather live life how I want to live it, be who I want to be, than constantly worry about pleasing someone i've never met and have no genuine connection with. Even then, I don't think you can fake faith. If there is a ""God"" in the end, I feel like they would know if you actually believed in them or not. So I would rather not waste my time worshipping them for the fruit of my labor to be rotten. I would rather burn in hell than be part of something I have no interest in. I feel like many people who convert do it out of fear rather than actually wanting to follow that faith. I hate the idea of doing anything not because I wanted to, but because I was scared of what would happen if I didn't. And in the end I think its pretty honorable, staying true to oneself and beliefs.

What I mean is, you will often get atheists or non religious people coming to subs like this and others *demanding* an explanation for a, usually, decontextualised verse of the hebrew scripture. I have seen many examples of this on different subs and discord servers where the religious people they are demanding a response from patiently explain in great detail that that verse is understood in a metaphorical way, or goes alongside very demanding legal practices, or that that particular verse is taken to be superceded by Jesus' new testement, or that it has a lot of commentary by religious authorities further explaining and elaborating on it.

And then interestingly, rather than thanking these responses for increasing their understanding of religious practice, a lot of times the OP will angrily deny these responses and demand a literalist and fundamentalist explanantion of the verse without any refence to tradition or commentary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do wonder though why this is? Why would people who presumably don't believe any of a particular scripture, demand that the followers of a faith take it to be both literalist and fundamental with no explanatory commentary?

 

Most religions, and the vast majority of Christianity, do not work on a scripture alone - or Sola Scriptura - undertsanding of faith. For instance, in Islam you have the hadiths as a secondary 'in practice' source of religious understanding, and on top of that the various schools of Islamic thought. In Judaism the *central* text is the Talmud - which is commentary on the Hebrew Bible! And then on top of that you have several thousand years of Rabbinic commentaries. In Christianity the Bible is a product *of* and is understood *alongside* Sacred Tradition. I presume the same goes for the Vedas, the Tipitaka, etc."

Personally, my belief (and strictly my belief) is that there is no evidence for the individual Adam and that the story of Adam is a metaphor from God to teach us of the effects of not being at peace with things outside our control, like it’s articulated here:


https://www.reddit.com/user/ThunderingDonkeyKick/comments/kx3rke/the_story_of_adam_and_eve_a_metaphor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

For those of you who also think it’s a metaphor, as well as those who also believe it’s literal, what do you make of this understanding of the story of Adam and Eve? What alternative or other lessons can be learnt?

For instance, a literalist interpretation might be that Adam sinned due to disobeying God, not because the fruit was intrinsically bad, showing the importance of obeying Allah regardless of our personal feelings.

religion,kwz609,Reverence for Life,"One of the central insights provided by Hinduism is reverence for all forms of life derived from the Vedic concept of the unity of existence. Life expresses itself in different forms yet it is the same life-force. Affinity with nature, natural elements and objects is woven into the tapestry of social and religious life of a Hindu and finds adequate expression in his day-to-day activity. Hinduism develops in one the capacity to feel and empathize by seeing oneself in the other. Love compassion and service are natural corollaries to this concept. By delineating the concept of interconnectivity with sentient and insentient beings, Hinduism helps one to understand that man may be the crown of creation but other living beings too have the right to live as they are undergoing a process of evolution inherent in creation. The plant kingdom has life but not consciousness which appears in animals. Man who is self-conscious and is able to carve out his own destiny stands higher than animals. Yet in the survival of all forms of life lies his own survival. Offering unparched rice and cereals to birds and ants, milk to snakes, flour-balls to the fish, fodder to stray animals and sacrificial food to the crow, cow and the dog, is common among the Hindus who show their gesture of goodwill towards innocent creatures (muka prāni) of nature in accordance with the Vedic injunction of performing Bhutayajňa, one of the five great sacrifices (pancamahayajňa) to be observed daily by a householder. Killing or causing pain to harmless creatures has no place in the mainstream Hinduism and is strictly prohibited in the Vedas."

*Science does not know what schizophrenia is. There are plenty of theories, but none are actually accepted. People born blind do not develop schizophrenia - it has never happened. Is it genetic? All the schizophrenics went into the concentration camps during the Holocaust, and after the war, the rate of schizophrenia did not diminish.*

*Now, what can cause these voices? How about a cochlear implant? A small neuroprosthetic is inserted into the brain and can stimulate a nerve to hear sound. Could something like this introduce voices into the mind? Well... it does. Could advanced technologies stimulate the other senses as well? Is it possible that one day, perhaps in one-hundred years, Humanity will have the technology to read thoughts and dreams, and even make the mind hallucinate? I think that this technology is possible. Could it already exist?*

*I have had conversations with thousands of voices since 2012, and little bits start coming together. I was told that sometime over 5000 years ago, a King in the far-east wanted to conquer the entire Earth in secret. Freemasonry was born. Small groups, with complete silence, truth to your boss, and obedience to your boss. Using this technique, his government had the entire world in 500 years. The small groups grew, and they hid on secret estates all over the Earth. Nobody knew they were out there, or where they were, unless you were set free. With massive libraries, they began learning as much as they could at the top of the ancient pyramid.*

*Twenty-seven hundred years ago, it became magical. With implants that can read and control the thoughts of people and animals, while interfacing with supercomputers. You are talking about ancient magic - nothing that breaks the laws of physics, of course, but incredible technologies.*

*These implants, a fine wire, can read your thoughts and walk you around with you simply holding them with your fingers. They sneak themselves into the brain the day you are born. They are in all the wildlife, but they cannot implant themselves underwater, so marine life is not under control.*

*How does possession work? Free people visit a little estate (which is anywhere with an airport,) walk into the arcade, sit on the couch with a touch screen in their hands. You are the television, the screen is the controller. They can walk you around like a costume, see out of your eyes, talk to you through your thoughts, and even do what seems like magic for you. There are other interfaces, though. Such as screens that can move the Human Race as one. Or, you may be able to chill out on a safe estate while seeing the thoughts of Mankind. You glance at everyone fast, and can magically see everything. Quite the past-time, listening to all of Humanity, and it is just a quick glance, then you have anyone on your screen.*

*Twenty-one-hundred years ago, some expert theologians got together, and said, ""One day, we are going to play God. Now let's figure that out."" They knew how God does things, and it is through divine judgement of Kings. That the King is the hinge between Heaven and Earth, if the King practices dharma, then the Earth is peaceful and beautiful (God's Reward.) If the King practices adharma, then the Earth is chaos and darkness (God's Wrath.) They developed the technologies to shake the Earth and even move the clouds. With this and the implants, Humanity knew how to play God in a very real and scary way.*

*In 430 a child prayed for everything, and in 448 the Human Race took the role of Divine Judge from Sol (the true God,) and placed it in their own hands. Possession was available to the free public. God on Earth did not judge the Kings of the nations, they chose the King. Being one of the ancient Kings was the coolest thing a man could receive. Whatever he wanted, all over the Earth, in an elegant and magical puppet show. If he got drunk and stupid, a war would break out on the other side of the planet, and 30,000 would die over the year. If he shared his lunch with a stranger, the rain would fall on the crops, the Sun would shine, and there would be an abundance. It was a beautiful and magical game.*

*As time went on, the game slowly corrupted. After 1000 years, they wanted to end it, but those at God's House didn't want to quit and nobody could afford the price that had to be paid. Every earthquake, hurricane, drought, plague, famine, war, shooting on the Earth... all of it, a magical puppet show, done by arrogant men wanting to play their role as Lucifer and usher in the Messiah's arrival.*

*By the 21st century, it was dark. With so much chaos, so many Kings dead, and the entire world praying for the Messiah... an unexpected eclipse shades the King in 2012.*

*Since then, I have had thousands of voices, different people all over the Earth visiting me in my dreams, and seeing some of the strangest and most beautiful magic Humanity can use. The Great Awakening will take place and Humanity will be freed.*

**\~ Part Two \~**

*When I was a child, I lost my rock and said ""I hate you, God!"" then got scared. At that moment, Sol looked at me and said, ""Eric, you are my son now."" Someone at God's House heard my prayer and said ""In fifteen years, that boy will get his every last wish as the King of the world."" I had no idea.*

*In 2006, I was stationed at Maxwell AFB, in Montgomery, Alabama. I go to a car dealer and find a Mazdaspeed Miata. Mazdaspeed? Godspeed. I put a license plate on it that said ""ATHEIST."" I was swarming with demons after getting that plate.*

*In 2007 I got back from Iraq and got my first tattoo. The Deftones White Pony. This tattoo was a miracle by Sol. Someone good at God's House then inspired me to move to a neighborhood in Montgomery called Halcyon. This means ""Kingfisher."" I then got a tattoo on my back. In hindsight, it was a demon tattoo. I had the Kingfisher demon on my back. At Halcyon, I was drinking bloody Mary's and V-8 like crazy. If you are a schizo and you are drinking V-8, you're about to kill yourself.*

*I end up with a part-time job at Target working Loss Prevention. God inspired me to buy a Secure Beneath the Watchful Eyes poster. My dad then commits suicide. He was murdered by Halcyon. About a month later, Sol inspires me to remove the White Pony tattoo. I had no idea any of this was going on behind my eyes. The Hindu Prophecy states that: ""Kalki, 'The White Horse,' will arrive at the end of the dark age to destroy the wicked and restore purity and righteousness.""*

*In 2010 I got out of the Air Force and in 2011 I became the King with Divine Judgement by people playing God. The people judging me did not wake me up and tell me what I had. I start getting paranoid and OCD. In October of 2011, I moved to Marysville, CA to stay with my grandmother.*

*On Sunday, April 8, 2012, I had a sudden bright thought and said to myself ""I am awake."" I looked this up online and learned the Buddha said this. I said to myself ""I am a Buddha."" The stars aligned over the enlightenment. It was Easter Sunday, Buddha's Birthday, and we were celebrating the Maya Calendar (Maya is Buddha's mother.) Four days later, the TV was about me and people started to talk to me through the voices in my head.*

*Six weeks later after the enlightenment, on Sunday, May 20, 2012, there was a ring-of-fire eclipse over Northern California. I went to the Marysville Buddhist Church that day, and the koi were spawning for the first time in 18 years. While I was by the pond, a little red-headed koi fish was conceived. We met several weeks later. I named him Ichthys, which means ""Jesus fish."" The stars aligned over the koi. He was conceived at the Buddhist Church, under the ring-of-fire, in Marysville (Mary is Christ's mother.)*

*The White Horse, Enlightenment, and Koi, were miracles performed by Sol while those at God's House looked on.*

*The White Horse is the Hindu Messiah.*

*The Enlightenment is the Buddhist Messiah.*

*The Koi is the Christian Messiah.*

*Kingfisher? I'm the Jesus fish.  At least, that's what's been going on in my head.*"

True seekers first pass a phase called 'Self-realization' before they arrive at 'God-realization'. At the end of their search, they realize that God doesn't dwell in a temple, synagogue or church. God is within."

religion,kwaben,Hinduism is Scientific not Dogmatic,"Although Hinduism is rooted in śraddhā and vișvāsa i.e. complete faith in the design and working of the grand plan of the universe by the Supreme Being, it does not rule out enquiry. Far from being dogmatic, it considers knowledge to be the key to immortality (vidyāyamŗtamśnute-Iśāvasyopaniśad, Rhyme XI) and views it in a holistic manner, disdaining a fragmentary approach to the world of phenomena. Hindu religious thought has never been in conflict with science, the reason being that both are believed to compliment and supplement each other. While religion finds out the truth on the plane of the spirit, science discovers it on the the plane of the mind and the senses. Vedic science does not reduce everything to matter and its attributes but provides a spiritual praxis to the existential reality. Hinduism has never punished its Galileos and Brunos for holding views contrary to the conventional religious beliefs.

The Hindu sages and mystics worked in the laboratory of their inner self and derived grains of truth through intuition which a modern scientist would derive in his laboratory through experiment. Self realization did not deplete their cognitive ability but rather enhanced it by lacing it with a higher perspective to perceive the world in a holistic light. They saw through the inner eye what a scientist would perceive through gadgets and instruments and communicated through telepathy what anyone today would do through a mobile phone. They sensed the vibrations emanating from the source of Supreme Intelligence, creating orderliness in the whole universe from planets, plants and animals to humans, and came to the conclusion that all existence is one. After experiencing the presence of the same self in all beings and objects, they were surcharged with a universal vision.

In Hinduism, science is built into philosophy (darśana), philosophy into mythology, mythology intro rituals, rituals into beliefs and beliefs into dharma. A common man may be ignorant of the scientific value of such useful plants, trees and herbs as neem, pīpal, tulasi, palāśa, haldi or sesamum seeds but he is benefitted nevertheless when he uses them in ritualistic observances and in daily life. Likewise, one who performs sacrifice to gods, the Deva Yajňa by way of fire-ritual, the Agnihotra, as a matter of religious duty enjoined by the Vedas, may not know that it purifies the air, kills bacteria, cures many diseases of the respiratory system and takes away depression. Hinduism incorporates scientific findings and the understanding of natural laws into the pattern of daily life of people. Ceremonial acts, sacrificial rites, fairs and festivals, vigils, vratas, etc. embody a deeper truth than can be observed on the surface. The same is true of the Hindu mythological lore with its unique characters, ideals and symbols.

Hinduism puts forth the idea of cosmic unity in which both the animate and the inanimate worlds are integral and one. To realize the fact of universal consciousness in each object, howsoever insignificant it might appear to be, is to experience a paradigm shift in oneself from self consciousness to universal consciousness. Hinduism shows the way to self transcendence through self purification, self conquest and self enlightenment. It provides a spiritual praxis to all enterprises, social, economic, religious, cultural and political, and explains how wordly duties can be turned into sādhanā (worship) by being rooted in the self."

religion,kw851d,Historical evidence and Islam/General Abrahamic religions (OP=agnostic),"Hey, I wanted to ask a general question for all the Muslims on here or anyone who adheres to an Abrahamic religion. How do you reconcile the supposed lack of evidence of any of the prophets/patriarch's existence (Minus David/Dawud and probably Isiah too). Archaeology in the near east kinda started off as a way to find evidence of Abraham, Noah, Moses's existence..etc, yet modern archaeological consensus is that there is no historical evidence of these prophets ever existing, coupled with the fact that the stories seem to be similar to many Near East legends of the region, and that a literal historical Adam and Eve could have not existed. I also find it interesting how the earliest forms of Judaism could have started, according to historians, with a henotheistic pantheon (polytheistic but with heavy reverence to one God) with special focus towards Yahweh, that merged with an El-focussed religion, to produce the foundation of the Abrahamic religions. If, as theorized by historians, Judaism emerged from pre-existing polytheistic beliefs (one can argue that it became corrupted from {whose?} earlier messages), then this brings doubt on the authenticity and divine origin of all the Abrahamic religions.

religion,kw4f49,It's no wonder Gods revealed them selves to us,"This is not an original thought I'm sure, but it is a new thought to me.

Of all the things in this universe that can bring about absolute destruction, from black holes to comets, from volcanoes to earthquakes, there is nothing living and breathing on earth that has that much power, than human beings them selves. No animal or plant, no virus or bacteria, has that much power. All flora on land might die, but life in the depth of the ocean will live on. A virus might plague the earth, but trees will continue to breathe.

But humans, they can control the power of the elements, they can control the power of the atom, at the flick of a single switch they can decimate the core of the earth, shatter its atmosphere and leave the planet but nothing but a ring of dust orbiting a meaningless star. No matter if you're Amazonian or Egyptian, Muslim or Hindu, Jewish or Christian, next to the Gods, there is nothing that can threaten their creation and bring about absolute destruction but a human being.

So it's no wonder they made them selves known to us. As a loose Christian, it makes some sense to me why God is called the Father, and why we are described as his Children. Because we are the naive vulnerable brats of the Gods, the irresponsible spawn of the all mighty and ever lasting, the ignorant youth in which nothing has ever rivaled the power to create and the power to destroy, until now.

From the moment we first awoke to the moment I type this, their words have lived on. No story or tale, no form of language or text has ever survived longer, than the words of the Gods. Because we need guidance, we need responsibility, we need to know the difference between right and wrong and good and evil. Because from the most infinitesimal spec to the highest of the high, we are the next most powerful thing, so powerful we are almost Gods our selves.

Perhaps it is not wise for such a sentient being to exist, not least without intervention. We might have been made in the image of God but we were certainly not made in the mind of God. Something that is all knowing surely knows all that there is to be known, but something that is still learning can only learn by example or learn by mistake. And when that thing holds that much power, untapped ready to be unleashed at any moment, we need to learn to behave and act like Gods before we make the most grave mistake, to preserve that which they created.

religion,kvzude,The Ideological Split of Christianity,"I was in a Discord call on the ACA server, and we were talking about the involvement of fundamentalist Christianity and its influence on the insurrection against the Capitol. Ultimately, this drove us into further discussion on the ideological basis of Judaism (that being the 'chosen people,' a common justification for white supremacy), the precursor to Christianity, which led me to ask the question: why are some people of the opinion that God is love and acceptance, and others that obedience and fear are His tenets?

These two ideologies can be correlated with conservative and liberal (I mean conservative and liberal in a social sense, not economic) demographics. Typically, from my experience and the experience of others, metropolitan areas are predominantly liberal and have more LGBTQ+ accepting churches, softer doctrine, and an overall idea of love and acceptance. However, in more rural areas, I have seen a sharp contrast. Whether it be through highway billboards, a Baptist radio broadcast, or a regular Sunday in church, the predominant ideas are sin, repentance, and obedience.

Finally, this leads to an important question: are we witnessing an ideological split in Christianity? It's a change, I have noticed, that transcends denomination, that transcends even the Catholic-Protestant split, and I am only wondering, is it really happening? And if it is, what could be prompting such a massive shift?"

I further find that the only theistic God which holds up to the scrutinization of critics as well as questioning Christians, as I was many a time, is the Christian God. I'm sure there are many objections but I do hope that I can address anyone's question successfully. 

One thing I find interesting is the question that many people ask both atheists and theists is, ""what would it take for you to hold the opposite"". If I were to answer that question I would probably say that it would simply take someone correctly objecting to any and all of the arguments that I hold up as the best direct evidences for God."

Man, the microcosmic manifestation of the universe is regarded as ‘the child of immortal bliss’ (amritsya putrah-Śvetaśvatāra upanishad II.5) having an infinite possibility to grow and develop in term of his nature. Divinity was instilled into him at the time of creation (Atharvaveda, XI.8.13) and he who becomes aware of this fact considers himself Brahman, or the supreme godhead (brahmeti manyate–Atharvaveda XI.8.32) By giving precedence to the ultimately beneficial path (śreya marga) over the pleasurable path (preya marga). Hinduism helps one to realize the truth as contained in the popular upanishadic aphorism – Tattvamasi – ‘You are that Brahman’ and sarvam khalu idam brahma – ‘ All this creation is Brahman’."

Hi all! First time posting here. Apologies English is not my native tongue, though I mostly dream in English.

I had a weird dream today, in which I woke with goosebumps as I didn't understand the context of the dream, but it was probably the most vivid feeling dream I've ever had.

For Context: I normally dream a lot normally in the morning hours just before waking up and have heard of lucid dreams, but I've never been able to be in any control of my Dreams whatsoever. I've also had dreams lately that I'm fighting something, but either my swings or punches are very weak like punching air. 

I'm not religious in any way, I don't even know where I would classify myself in religion. Even though my mother's side very is religious (Roman Catholic mainly). I  can't remember when was the last time I went to church. I don't have any formal religious schooling and have always leaned toward looking at things from a scientific perspective vs. a spiritual one.

In my dream today, I encountered myself in a great hall /classroom type, the area was very open and I couldn't tell where it ends in any direction aside from the floor that I was standing on. There were figures sitting down in a row ( 9x9 ) but I couldn't make up their faces, or body shape in any way aside from one figure that seemed to have a slight reddish/gold glow and the one I interacted with. I asked this figure what it wants, and it responded by saying ( ""nothing yet"" ), I later ask for someone (can't recall the name), and this figure said, no I didn't take him, but Manuel was taken by Ruach. To which I had a reaction like if this person was very closed to me, and I scream and cried oh, no!. ( I don't know anyone by the name of Manuel or a Ruach ). The figure showed me a sheet of paper with a different language writing, somehow I was able to able to understand and there it was the name \* Manuel - taken - Ruach \*. There were other names in this paper but I don't remember them as this is what stuck to me in the dream. I asked the figure who are you? and it responded saying its name is Cilia/ Zillah (something along with that name) and that's where I woke up.

Thanks!"

I did not want to download so much. I just, wanted to watch some scenes from an episode  but ocd was telling me to avoid download because it is a sin.

I did not want to obey my ocd, so I tried to download. Luckily, the download did not start but still, I worry. Why I felt so anxious? What if Gods considered as a good idea to punish me for sinning by downloading pirated stuff, with what my intrusive thoughts were telling?"

religion,kv9f3l,"G-d is ONE, not a Trinity. Every single time G-d speaks in the Torah He speaks in the singular – one.","[G-d is ONE, not a Trinity](https://nojesus4jews.weebly.com/sophiees-blog/g-d-is-one-not-a-trinity#)

Never does G-d speak as a “plurality” (e.g. a trinity or more).    

The fact that we are clearly told G-d is one (אֶחָד / eḥad – D'varim / Deuteronomy 6:4)  is only one way we know He is not a trinity – throughout the Jewish bible this important “oneness” and “alone” (Yeshayahu / Isaiah 44:24) and “singularity” is repeated over and over so the lesson is not missed.  

G-d is not a man (Bamidbar / Numbers 23:19), 

“So said the L-rd. . . the ONE who formed you from the womb, “I  (singular) am the L-rd . . .Who spread out the earth ALONE (לְבַדִּ֔י).”  Yeshayahu / IIsaiah 44:24,  

and we are told G-d is one (D'varim / Deuteronomy 6:4).   But now see – it is I! I am the only One! There are no (other) gods with me! (Deuteronomy 32:39).

Over and over and over again we are told that G-d is ONE, alone, by Himself – SINGULAR.

#1 – “אֶחָד / eḥad ” means “one.”  It is the same as the number one in English.    

“G-d is one” (D'varim / Deuteronomy 6:4).  

Some Trinitarians like to point out that “אֶחָד / eḥad ” can be a compound unity – (as in “one forest” which has many things in it).  

אֶחָד / eḥad  can be a compound unity (see B'reshit / Genesis 2:24 as an example) – but far more often it is an “absolute one” and not compound at all.   The word ""One"" in this  D'varim Deuteronomy 6:4  (the Shema) ""the L-rd is One"" is not a compound unity.  It is definitely singular.

Examples of this “absolute one” can be found in  Shmuel 2 / 2 Samuel 13:30: ""Absolom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left"" and 2 Samuel 17:12: ""And of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.""  "

I tried to download an episode but my ocd kept telling me that Gods maybe will punish me with my ocd fear.

Many times, I was making ocd to stop by thinking that I have ocd and that hte promises do not count but What about sins?

I downloaded in the past, but some minutes ago, I was ready to download and I was having intrusive thoughts that were connecting my ocd fear of punishment with the sin.

I tried to ignore ocd and tried to download.Luckily, the site did not download. it was not letting me or got stuck.

what if I got punished just, because I tried to download, even though I did not download? (because the site did not download)

why i was having these intrusive thoughts and anxiety? was it me or Gods were trying to warn me?

I worry that I did not want so much to download. I just, wanted to see some scenes to pass time. I was anxious and wanted to leave and not download but I thought that will give ocd more power. So, I tried to download but the download did not start. But, still I worry"

 Today, I just, wanted to download and ocd was giving me warnings. I started worrying that Gods (in case Christian God is not real) accepted the intrusive thoughts about that punishment if in case I sin by downloading pirated stuff.

 I felt anxious and my mind was having intrusive thoughts. As if something was telling me not to download. I wanted to ignore my ocd and downlaod what I wanted. 

 My anxiety was getting higher but I did not want to obey my ocd. I was having intrusive thoughts like "" this is it. either I risk by clicking download or I obey my ocd"" I clicked to download but luckily, the site did not download.

 What if Gods decided to punish me for trying to sin (if it is a sin) with a punishment that is related to my ocd fear? I did not download but what if Gods punished me just by trying to download? I think the site got stuck or was not letting me. I have a big anxious feeling as if I have done something wrong.

I have downloaded from that site in the past with no worries but I today, I was having thoughts like ""what if Gods will punish me just, because I thought about it?"""

Through analysis of the Bible, hell is a place where the soul is destroyed not tortured. It is a place that God created, not one satan rules. Demons do not reside in hell and don’t torture the dead. Also, good people can go to hell.

There are so many contradictions with religions in general but so many when it comes to the subject at hand. If someone can explain to me the truth of hell. 

In my opinion I’m 100% positive of a God existing. I believe Jesus Christ did walk the earth. I don’t not believe the church giving additional rules. I believe that God is truly loving and forgiving. I don’t believe God would make a disgusting and horrifying place of eternal torture."

I'm more interested in the notion that everybody eventually gets a shot at being everyone else.  By ""gets a shot"" I don't mean that we would have the opportunity to be, for example, a kinder and gentler Hitler.  Instead, I'm referring to the idea that each and everyone of us at some point in time will be Hitler in every way that he was and will do everything he did.

This last aspect I believe would seemingly be necessary under such a scenario, so some level of determinism or compatabilism are required.  Such a notion would also depend on something like the B theory of time ruling the roost at least at the plane of existence on which such a dance of Saṃsārac permutations played out.  Aside from these two possible requirements, it seems that a variant of monism could imply or be consistent with it.

I don't hold this position and am agnostic on the general idea of reincarnation, but something about this just hits me intuitively.  I was very young when the notion first popped into my head but then it kind of hit me like a brick a few years back when I saw one of the clips from Ted Bundy's trial in which he looks right at a camera and smiles.  His eyes and expression seemed to exude the idea in a weird way.  So, I'm not going on any rational reasoning on my own viewing of this as a possibility.

I am usually reluctant to openly entertain thought experiments that involve determinism.  I'm always annoyed by people using it as an excuse for themselves or others (even though they may have no choice in the matter).

Anyway, I've rarely been using reddit for quite a while and thought I should give this subreddit a try on this inquiry before going down a research rabbit-hole."

As an atheist, you might be tempted to say that whether or not religion helps to better society, has no bearing on the validity of the supernatural claims they make, as Dawkins told Hasan, which is absolutely correct, but the utility of religion and not it's veracity is being discussed here. To say that religion only has negative effects and that religious good people are so not because of their religion but in spite of it, as quite an ignorant thing to say and also an hyperbolic.

There seems to be so much hate and anger in the world lately and we can never tell when our time is going to be up.  Apologies for any typos and grammar issues, it's late where I am and I will sleep soon.  It looks like this meets the rules for this sub, sorry if it does not.

**The Universe as a room**

Think of the universe as a room with a curtain at one end.  No one from this side of the curtain can see anything on the other unless we cross over but then we cannot go back.  Sometimes someone hears something from the other side or maybe sees the curtain moving, but it's very unlikely that more than one person saw or heard any one thing at a time because the curtain is so big.

**The Room as Life and Spirituality**

""God"" is what was originally on the other side of the curtain.  Whether god created this side or the other side or both or neither is irrelevant. There may even be more than one ""god"", we can't really tell.  All we can tell is some people claim to have seen or heard something that went like ""Come visit when you're done over there, you seem like a cool bloke and I'm lonely.""  Some people wrote this stuff down when they witnessed it, which is how religions started.  God is trying to explain to us how we can get through the curtain to visit them specifically.  It seems you need to be the ""right shape"".  Or more properly, don't be the ""wrong shape"".  It really depends on the God.  If you make the right shape by the time you pass through you end up where you wanted.  But if you aren't the right shape, nothing bad happens.  Turns out there is a place for everyone.  You end up with all the other folks that have the same shape as you.  That may not be a good outcome for everyone because they may be sharp and pointed, in a room with lots of other sharp and pointy people.  That's not punishment though, that's just you hanging with the folks most like you on the other side.

**Christianity Explained Through The Room Metaphor**

**Old Testament - the short version** 
God originally tried communicating with the folks on the our side.  It was difficult for the folks on our side to understand.  God was explaining everything perfectly but we just didn't understand.  It kind of sounded like god said god made us.  Or maybe not.  Some people did horrible things because they misheard or misunderstood what god said to them.  Other people who hadn't personally heard this god, or perhaps were ""listening"" to another god also did horrible things to people.  Sometimes god seemed to do horrible things to people.  It seemed like everyone was doing horrible things to other people.  God was sad about that because god was just trying to get us to visit, but sometimes god pulled some people through the curtain in ways that seemed horrible to us. There was a lot of yelling and wroth.  Kind of like talking loudly to deaf people.  God tried talking very loudly several times, that got a lot of people through the curtain but didn't look comfortable at all (floods, pillars of salt, fire, etc.).

**New Testament**
God eventually had a better idea on how to communicate with us on this side of the curtain.  God had noticed that even though we could sort of hear we were blind and communicated best by grabbing and touching each other's hands.  How limiting god must have thought of us only being able to feel hands on our side of the curtain.  Turns out, god could pass his own arm through the curtain and touch us with his hand.  God was so happy that he could finally interact with us using his hand just like we use our hands (let's call his hand Jesus).  God closed his eyes and felt only through his hand with us to feel like we felt.  God tried to explain how his hand is really him as well as his hand.  Oh, but there is another part that we could kind of experience... his arm (let's call that The Holy Ghost).  Yes, the arm was also god.  But we could experience it as something we couldn't explain because we only touch hands.  How could three different things be exactly the same thing?  It's hard to see but it really didn't matter, god was just trying to explain to help us understand how this hand we were talking to was different than the other hands that were talking about god.

Turns out, god's hand had some good news for us.  Here's the best way to come visit him:  Be nice to other people.  Don't be mean to other people.  Help other people that need help.  Treat your side of the room with respect (nobody wants a messy, annoying guest after all).  Oh, don't bother trying to judge other people shapes, we can't perceive the correct shape.  Judging the other people's shapes incorrectly can change your shape so don't do that!  In fact, there were ten very specific things that you also shouldn't do!  But here was the best part.  If your shape wasn't quite right by the time you make it to the curtain, it's ok.  All you had to do is have tried your best to make the shape AND understand where you missed AND you honestly want to fix the thing that you did wrong.  God can help you through if you can do that. Life's hard, god understands.  Sometimes you can't make the right choice, or there was no right choice, or you made a mistake.  It happens.  If you're truly sorry, god will help you through to him.  If you weren't really sorry, no biggie... you just can't visit with (this) god, but you end up with all the other folks with your shape.  Is this bad?  I don't know... how were you acting?

After a bunch of folks went over the curtain, these people found out that some of them could yell through the curtain and sort of influence people on this side of the curtain.  Not a lot, compared to god, but if they were the right shape before god helped them through... they can sort of do something to the other side of the room.  Maybe blowing really gently in one area.  Each of these people get known for a particular event that happens (let's call these people saints). 

Everything else about Christianity is Religion.  Religion is just some peoples' ideas about how to make the proper shape.  Some of it is useful.  Some of it is just superstition.  Some of it only matters if you really mean it when you do it (did you give that poor person $5 because they needed help or because someone told you it was the right thing to do?)

**Summary**

So in the end, what kind of people do you want to be around?  Usually it's nice people that aren't mean, are willing to help others when they need it, and don't trash the place.  Be that person and you will be ""sorted"" into that group.  It's not god that decides your journey, it's your actions, thoughts, and intentions.  Words don't matter unless they help you personally focus one or more of the things that matter.  Would you rather have someone help you because they wanted to help you or because they felt they had to in order to get in a better place?  Be the person you want to experience.

**My Personal Thoughts**

I've never understood why there is so much hate amongst Christians (Baptists, Evangelicals, Catholics, etc.).  Everyone seems to hate or look down upon other, even though the core of their tenants are all the same.  Worse, some Christians want to force others down their own path because it's the ""right"" one therefore all the other paths are ""wrong"".  They are literally doing everything they ""believe"" that god told them not to do (especially the ""don't judge others"" bit).  All you have to do to see this is turn on the TV to the news and look at what ""Christians"" do in the name of their god.  Turns out you can't hide from god because god is just a reflection of how you act.  There is no judgement.  Hope you like being around people just like yourself.  Don't like that?  Turns out you still have time to change.

What do you think?

religion,ktgqtg,Let's talk polytheism,"So I would love to hear from the various polytheists that browse this forum.  I know the basics of different forms of polytheism from lesser and greater gods that pagans believe in, the devas of Buddhism, and the quasi polytheism of some forms of Hinduism existing in a oneness with a great creator god.  


I guess this idea interests me  because I grew up Christian in a western Protestant world, became atheist in college, and then moved toward something completely different after.  I say brief prayers to gods that are currently unknown to me, but I would like to learn more about it.  I may have references the more Eastern ideals of these faiths because I am a true believer in many of their ideas; I believe in light, love, and energy, I meditate and believe channels or chakras can be blocked or open, and I do physical asanas in order to be better with my meditation primarily, though I believe ""yoga"" as the western world would call it has many, many different uses.  


That's my story; what is yours?  How did you come to polytheism and particularly what do you believe in?  Know that this post (and this sub in general, but I thought I'd single it out) is a complete safe space and I am looking for any beliefs."

religion,ktdpls,Would you consider this metal song religious?,"I've stumbled upon a metal band called Klaymore while looking up metal music. Looking through their songs, they apparently wrote a song about the character of Samson (a character found in the Book of Judges, a sacred text to both Jews and Christians). Its called 'Temple of Dagon' if you want to look up the lyrics.

To me, it reflects the type of songs metal bands often make about ancient (mostly Norse) myths. This has left me wandering if this guy meant anything religious by this or not. 

The way he words it, it honestly makes it look almost like a hymnal song, rather than a song about an old action story. I have no idea what religion the band members are. They're not that popular, so its hard to find information about them.

On a side note, I've noticed the guy behind the project doesn't seem to take what he's doing all too seriously. His youtube channel is filled with him doing metal covers of theme songs from video games. The first place I ever saw him, he was singing a parody heavy metal song in a video meant to demonstrate various sub-genres of metal. 

I don't know, what do you think of this? If you're one of those Christians that hates metal for w/e reason, you can easily find the lyrics online. Besides, its hard to understand what he's saying without them anyway. I didn't catch the theme of the song at all until I looked up the lyrics."

religion,ksto37,Spiritual Aviation – The Inward Journey,"Hinduism is as vast and open as the sky. It has no boundaries, barriers or set routes for one who wishes to undertake an inward journey and soar high into the firmament of consciousness. No passport is required from a priest certifying one’s caste or identity; no security-check is needed at the airport of orthodoxy, and no terminals are laid for the aircraft of the self to take off or land in the confines of one’s faith.

In a spiritual experience of mystical dimensions, one is oneself the airport, the flying machine, the fuel, the pilot, the air hostess, the radar, the path and the destination.

The only valid document for spiritual travelling is one’s earnestness; security check is the restrain on the senses; terminals can be laid at any point in the radii of one’s being; airport is within the inner recesses of one’s heart; flying instrument is one’s own mind which requires the aeronautics of self knowledge; fuel is an inflammable urge for self-enfoldment; pilot in the cockpit is the individual self; air hostesses are one’s sensory organs; the radar is one’s own conscience, the path is the chosen one of realised souls and the destination is infinity. The pilot has to traverse the path himself; the spiritual preceptor cannot guide him beyond the take-off stage.

One can operate at an altitude and at a speed according to one’s spiritual clock (like its counterpart at biological level) which functions in tune with the levels of inner awareness. As one flies past the clouds of ignorance and the mist of egoism, the infinite is seen in the universe and the universe in the infinite. All become one in the indivisible whole called God.

Since the infinite has infinite dimensions, inner experiences may assume infinite forms seemingly different from one another when expressed. The intensity and duration of an experience as also the quality of its expression may also vary from person to person. No spiritual experience worth the name can be disparaged or disputed as the experiencer has lived it himself. Nature observing some mystical protocol, does not leave a witness to vouchsafe for a personal experience. Each must experience the experience of the self to realize the eternal truth. It is like taking food to satisfy one’s hunger as none can eat by proxy on one’s behalf. A Hindu is free to describe his spiritual experiences without the least fear of being dubbed as a heretic."

I cant remember making the promise but I get bad feelings as if there are chances that I may have made one.

I am worrying for the punishment. I do not want it. Its an invisible punishment. I will give you a similar example (maybe).

Someone who has ocd, is being bugged by his ocd to watch a youtube video as a compulsion. He does not want to do it. He wants to say no to his ocd but he cant ignore it. So, he makes a promise to Gods not to see a video from youtube and asks to become bald but without being able to see the baldness. He makes the promise and asks for that scary punishment in order to force himself not to do the compulsion. He uses the fear of the punishment to fight his ocd. He does not want to make the promise but he is forced to.

He watches a picture from that video and worries that he may have be punished by becoming bald. He looks in the mirror but he cant see the baldness. He sees his usual hair. All other see that he is bald. I do not want to analyze it more because it triggers my ocd.

What if there are Gods (in case Christian God is not real) that do not care about my ocd and accept the promise?

The thing is that I CANT REMEMBER MAKING SUCH A PROMISE. I just, have a bad feeling coming from it AS IF there are chances that I made one. I think, the reason I worry so much is because for many months, I was having that bad feeling. So, having that bad feeling and being something like ""maybe there is a promise, I better avoid it"" for many months, made me believe that I may have made a promise. The question is why that feeling exists? Probably, because I had some random. intrusive thoughts about it and that created the bad feeling. So as time passed by, I forgot the intrusive thoughts (because they were random, uncontrolled thoughts) but the bad feeling remained. So, bad feeling and an hypothesis for many months, made the worry bigger."

religion,kseyd9,A really weird and kinda difficult thought that is hard to explain for me.,"so ive been thinking about this at the moment. but id consider myself at least agnostic, I dont claim to know enough about whats going on in the world to say what does and doesnt exist to me.

ive never been great at words and I usually end up accidentally offending people in really really unintentional ways. so here goes haha crossing my fingers and apologising in advance.

so even though I grew up in a church of england primary school, and then a catholic high school, it was only because the primary school was the local village one, and the high school was really only because it was known for being good at dealing with students who have disabilities or chronic illnesses (of which, I have both).

my parents, especially my mother, have always said believing is idiocy and make belief, and that only idiots would believe in an invisible ghost that makes everything happen.

but I was thinking right, logically it actually makes sense for one to exist in theory. If we think about how the world works it becomes rather suspicious/a lot to just say ""oh thats a coincidence"" on you know? if all life is random evolution, and has no design to it at all its just random mutations occuring. then why does evolution of a species of life happen so weirdly specifically and conveniently? why does most life share biological traits even on the otherside of the world? if its not at all planned?

why does a human for example, conveniently have a skeleton that protects its internal organs? your telling me we just randomly developed a trait that said hey, lets develop a full functioning bone structure. And then how come we just happened to get a muscle system to wrap around that skeleton and help it move? and then a nervous system that lets your brain command it? how come id just randomly develop organs that perfectly help me digest and deal with food and liquids I consume? 

how come then, if I removed even a tiny part from my legs, my legs would cease to function and I wouldnt be able to walk, are they serious telling me the thousands of components required to get my legs to walk and keep me upright and moving, all just randomly evolved in that perfect specific way to let me walk?


I say that no, its perfectly logical to perhaps assume it may have been designed, and what designs something? a living creature with a mind to design yes? so therefore what would design creatures before civilization had even existed? a god, or at least a being with power so great it is beyond our understanding or comprehension as their constructs. so no, god is not a stupid idea, and god does not defy science or logic, from this it makes sense to me that there might be one. There may not be rules or a right way to live or be as a person sure, and one should just try to be a good person in the end of the day and kind to others and yourself, but a god just may exist according to how the universe works/functions."

religion,ks6tea,Unity not Uniformity,"Hinduism regards the Infallibility–syndrome as the prime cause of religious conflicts. It encourages debate (śāstrārtha) but shuns persecution. It disapproves of killing or arson in the name of religion or of offending the sensibilities of people of other faiths by commissioning preachers to convert them. Hinduism holds that each belief-system has an intrinsic value and appeal, and limitations too. It encourages unity not uniformity. Its evolution is not tainted by crusades or jihads, holy wars in the name of religion.

Although Hinduism is founded on the highest mystical experiences of illumined souls it does not claim to be the only vehicle of God’s work on the earth. It refrains from asserting, as do the semitic religions, that salvation is impossible outside its orbit. Spirituality being a matter of direct experience, worship or meditation by any means or through any object, howsoever puerile or crude it may appear to be, brings one nearer to the Supreme Being. What one needs is a pure heart and a genuine urge. Besides, salvation (mukti) in Hinduism is not an after-death experience but an attainment in this very life as affirmed by bhakti-saints. It is a state of dying while living; dying to the world of the senses and living in a state of god-consciousness. Spiritual insight (prajňa) renders Jivanamukti or emancipation (of the soul) possible during life, which is different from videhamukti, emancipation after death."

 making us take things way to seriously, being stuck in the past, being ruled by our emotions and the fear of being criticized.

If you don't already know our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life. Being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe.

Did he just say infinite?
Yes, and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being, point of view, and mental state.

Did he just say cosmic energy!?
Yes I did, and on the energetic side you can observe this cosmic energy inside of you when you get goosebumps from watching inspiring movies, listening to moving or exciting music, feeling eager, thinking about someone you love and more.

I've found many names for this energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps and many more.

If you want to learn how to really tap into this energy here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ds9BKmuT_7I) for you.

On a less deeper side, you can open yourself up to it by:
Letting go of all the baggages from your past, 
Not taking everything so seriously,
Stop letting yourself be ruled by your Emotions (mind over matter)
And by not blocking yourself from living life because of the fear of criticism from others.

One or all of these things combined will take away all of your power that you have from the now, your present."

In the article, he mentioned the 'enlightened atheism of Star Trek', when talking about franchises that clearly are written from an atheist point of view. The article was exploring whether or not there was any room for the religious in the science fiction community (he did end up naming a few examples, for the record, can't remember what they were though). 

Even today, religion is rarely mentioned in Star Trek (at least, real-world religions). Strangely enough, the only religious people to ever appear are always aliens; humans seem to almost always be atheist (aside for this one episode that apparently had the crew finding God, only to discover he was actually an evil alien entity, though one of the crew members refused to believe this despite it being so overwhelmingly obvious). 

I wonder about the fan base though. Oddly enough, my mother is a huge fan of the franchise, despite being Christian her whole life and a registered republican. Honestly, I would assume a Christian would take huge offense at this show. Religion is always depicted as being false, and a solely negative thing in the world. Of course, being an American show, it directs most of its hatred towards Christianity (that dinosaur episode I mentioned was clearly a bashing creationism) I have no idea why my mother likes it so much. Honestly, I never saw the appeal of it, even after I abandoned my faith. 

So, what do religious people think of this franchise? As I stated, it was the product of a secular humanist who openly hated religion, and the franchise has a long history of bashing on religion. I can find no evidence of it ever showing religion in a positive light. Keep in mind, I've never been a fan of it, and I've only ever seen one episode in its entirity (and it wasn't that dinosaur episode, actually, it was that episode where the pale guy, who is apparently an android, was reprogrammed by a copy of him or something)."
religion,krvs62,Greco-Caucasian Mythology.,"Hi everyone,

I came across the book ""*Nart Sagas from the Caucasus: Myths and Legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs""* by the scholar John Colarusso. In it, he discusses many similarities between indigenous Caucasian mythology and Greek mythology. I wanted to know if there are any other academic studies on the topic; my own research has wielded very little - much of what I can find is just echoing Colarusso's work (he seems to be one of them few contemporary scholars who have dedicated his work to Caucasian mythology).

Thank you!"

religion,krelgy,Experience not Pedagogy,"Hinduism is the only religion whose key scripture the Veda itself says that the higher knowledge (vidyā) comes not through pedagogy but through experience, the implication being that the true Veda is within a man’s being. All knowledge of the world of phenomena coming under the three guna–satttva (goodness), rajas (activity) and tamas (inertia) and known through sensory organs, is inadequate without knowing the knower, the source of all knowledge. Says the Mundakopanishad (I.1.5): ‘The Ātman cannot be attained by the study of scriptures or by intelligence or by much hearing of sacred books. It is attained by him who earnestly seeks it. To him the Ātman reveals its true form.’ Spiritual experience is the realisation of one’s true nature and of one’s virāta rupa (great form). It is a reverse journey of the soul from dhārā (downward flow) to Rādha or ascension to the lofty height of the supreme source as explained by the Vaishnava mystics."
religion,krekyo,How to approach Religion?,"This is kinda my opinion on the matter. I would like feedback and other opinions on how to approach this.

-""Also would like people to discuss things with..example: Islam, Christianity, Atheism.... etc I also have questions and such regarding common reasoning on subjects like: Testimonies, Jesus, Mohammad"".. 

Firstly, I'm not sure I like the word religion itself, because we are dealing with finding a fact of reality, are we not? Putting all faiths into this common group called religion makes it, especially in this day and age, a lot easier for people to disregard and not look into, read, hear or analyze any of it individually.. instead people just go on trying to live their lives (which is the biggest illogical crime, because then you blindly believing something). This is especially true seeing as how religion is represented in schools today.
The case is..  either it's true, or it is not. I am certain that when one should search for their ""belief"" one must do so without bias (meaning not assuming the religion you are born into is the real) and with logic, reason and an open-mind. The absolute first thing one should do however is to pray.. pray for guidance by God to reveal himself to you in your life, if that is what he wants for you. Look at it this way: if he is not real a honest prayer cannot hurt, but IF he is real it would help tremendously in theory... would it not? I mean people much smarter than me and you reading this post belive all kinds of things..and with their own reasoning behind it. I would argue that faith has nothing to do with intelligence, and everything to do with reasoning. I also believe that calling oneself agnostic is to be lazy. If you actually do the work you're probably gonna choose a side."
religion,kredmg,Question about allowance of intellectual exploration in various religious groups,"Hi everybody, this is my first time posting in this subreddit, so hopefully this is the right subreddit to ask this question (if isn't could please tell me a better place to ask it? thanks). I used to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (aka Mormons), and one of the things that was taught there was that members were only supposed to learn about the church through church approved sources. Anything that was critical of the church that was from an outside source was considered to be ""anti-Mormon"", regardless of whether or not that criticism was based on facts or not. It's hard to express just how much this idea was impressed in the members, and members are taught to not look at any ""anti-Mormon literature"", including looking things up about the church on the internet. So my question is this: is this common for religious organizations? If you are a member of a religion could you mention what your religious group is, and whether or not they discourage research about your religion outside of church approved sources? Thank you!"

&gt;  
&gt;As for those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers, God rejects them, as do the angels and all people.remaining therein forever. Neither will the punishment be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite. [https://quran.com/2/161-162](https://quran.com/2/161-162)

&gt;  
&gt;As for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them into  Gardens graced with flow-ing streams and there they will remain forever.  They will have pure spouses there, and We shall admit them into cool  refreshing shade.

religion,kqtoow,"Why do you subscribe to religion? (No judgement, genuinely curious)","I’m gonna start off with this—believe what you want. We all have the right to that, so long as you respect the beliefs of others and your beliefs do no harm to others. It really makes zero difference to me, I have my beliefs, you have yours. But I am genuinely confused as to the “why” of it. And I spent the first half of my childhood being Baptist, but I soon strayed from it when I started questioning it. For the sake of this post, I’m not gonna say what I believe, you can DM me for that if you want, I don’t care. I want to understand, not judge.

But why do you choose to subscribe to religion? Yes, there is the sociological comfort of it—it’s what you were raised with, it’s what is around you, and you have a community behind that, and you have your faith. But what does the social aspect have to do with the belief? Like, why does it matter to you what everyone else thinks when these are matters higher than our understanding? And why is faith enough for you? From a logical standpoint, it makes no sense. If religion was a boat, it would sink in a heartbeat with the logical fallacies within it, and we live in an age of science and logic—we are rational beings after all. If you believe in the literal truth of your religion, with each and every detail it is mathematically guaranteed that it is less likely to be true. Also, if God(s) (whatever that means to you) is truly the highest power, then would he not be the most logical being conceivable? Given that, mysticism cannot exist because it is illogical and science shows that the universe acts on pure logic and method. And isn’t faith therefore the most illogical thing possible, as it actively defies reasoning? (Again, no judgement passed.)

Another genuine question I have is this: what makes your religion right, and every single one else wrong? Anecdotal evidence really doesn’t hold up, because every single religion has anecdotal evidence. When you stand back, there really is no reason to believe one over the other, and therefore are they not null? And if you believe in the literal truth of your holy book, whichever one that is, how does that hold up logically? After all, if God is a higher being above human conception, then how could that even translate at all into the lower dimension of writing? There is no way for literal translation and understanding so there is no choice but for it to be in metaphors and symbolism just so our puny brains can process it? And why choose to believe in such tyrannical gods (note the lowercase g) when, if they were a human, they would be the most terrible dictator known to man? Infinite punishment for finite deeds? I’m sorry, but I just don’t see the live and mercy in that. I know, there is a lot of heresy in that, but if the creator gave us brains then clearly we are meant to use it to question things, including the creator, otherwise we would be dumb animals incapable of rational thought.

Also, has anyone noticed that all of our gods are extremely human-like? Even in their depiction, they are all at least humanoid. Does this not therefore beg the question that perhaps instead of us being fashioned in their image, we fashion them in ours? After all, these kinds of beings would need no tangible form as we know it, plus their minds would probably be very alien compared to us, since in the face of omniscience we truly are blind and stupid? 

I suppose one last thing is this: if it comes down to moral guidance, why do you think you NEED religion to know morality? It is completely and perfectly possible to be a good and genuine person without turning to religion for morality. I speak for myself and others I know, that is a first hand observation.

I know this might violate the rules of this thread, but once AGAIN—I am seeking answers only. I don’t want to persuade. I have my own beliefs, I don’t feel the need to force others to also believe what I believe. I think that to be morally wrong and I’d he a hypocrite if I did. I just want genuine discourse so I can better understand my fellow humans. I would talk to someone I know personally, but this is an extremely sensitive topic that I don’t entirely trust to not be pure discourse in real life. And please for the love of god don’t bicker in the comments, I don’t want to start a religious fight."

1) to confirm that it is legit to worry 
2)to teach my ocd that THERE IS NO NEED TO WORRY

i worry that by doing I may have partially, broken the hypothetical promise to Gods.

Hypothetical because I cant remember making such a promise. I remember having intrusive thoughts about a very similar ""thing"" of the video, in the past. Somehow, I connected this ""thing"" with my ocd.

 Since ocd has to do with promises to Gods, I ended up worrying that I MAY have made a promise to Gods not to ever interact with that what I may have promised.

 I worry that I may have partially, broken that hypothetical promise just from looking the thumbnail of a youtube video. I cant remember making a promise but for some reason, I get a bad feeling as if I may have made a promise. I cant remember making one. I think, I remember having some intrusive thoughts about that thing and only that. 

Maybe as time went by, I was avoiding that thing because of my intrusive thoughts. So, I ended up thinking that I may have made a promise (since my ocd has to do with promises and punishments) and asked for punishment. Maybe it is a false alarm.

My ocd is telling that I may have broken that hypothetical promise and that maybe I became uglier and unable to see the uglyness as part of the punishment."

religion,kqahoj,I bought a reddit account because I want to share my worry.,"In 2017, I was playing a pc game and used a mod for it. I think, in the future, when ocd fear of punishment from God appeared, I somehow, connected that mod with my ocd fear. Maybe, just random, intrusive thoughts.

In 2018, ocd promises appeared in order to fight ocd compulsions. There was almost, one time that the specific ocd fear of punishment was asked in case breaking a promise. I canceled the promise but I think, I never broke it.

In 2019, I was trying to see which ocd promises-compulsions, should be kept, no matter what! One of these ocd promises compulsions, was to avoid that mod from that pc game. I do not why I put it as, lets say, ""ocd potentially dangerous"" in my mind's list.

Yesterday, I was on youtube and my mouse pointer went to the thumbnail of a video that automatically, started playing in its small window. The video was about the SEQUEL of that game that I used mod in the past. And the video was about a mod for that sequel. I freaked and got worried. I was a little angry with my bad luck. I think, I wanted to look the thumbnail again, either to confirm that it was what I thought/read it was or either to persuade my ocd that THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. So, I looked at the thumbnail. I got worried more. Instead of avoiding looking it again, I looked it again because I thought that will calm me down. Maybe I thought that by avoid looking at it, will make my ocd worry more.

So, now I worry because ocd tells me that I may have broken a promise to Gods in which a punishment was asked in case breaking it. I cant remember making such a promise for that mod, but I worry becase in 2019, I labeled, lets say as something potentially, dangerous.

If, I ignore the fact that in 2019 I labeled it as I labeled it, and I try to remember if I ever made such a promise, I remember nothing and I come to a conclusion that I probably, never made a ""dangerous"" promise. Probably, only, just old, random, intrusive thoughts that connected it with my ocd fear. And since, my ocd has to do with promises, my ocd (FALSELY) connected it with a scary promise to Gods.

I analyzed it a lot yesterday. I think, the reason that I worry is because in 2019, my ocd labeled that mod as something dangerous. I tried to understand why. I think, I have one explanation. I think, ocd promises appeared in 2018. In 2018, the only dangerous promise that I remember was the promise that I canceled in the end and never broke. In 2019, I tried to remember a promise BEFORE that dangerous promise. Probably, my mind went to 2017 (when the general ocd fear of punishment appeared) and somehow, I remembered me playing that modded game and probably, having some intrusive thoughts about it.

But, if I analyze it more it gets a little more complicated. I remember playing that mod in July or early August of 2017. My ocd fear of punishment appeared 16-18 August of 2017. I can remember some things about that time and I do not remember playing that modded game.

What if, in 2018 (when ocd promises appeared) I was thinking to play the modded game again but due to some intrusive thoughts in 2017, I was afraid to download it. Maybe at that moment, some new intrusive thoughts popped up about making a promise to God to play that game. Maybe I ended up in a dilema and I decided to make a new promise that I will NOT play/use that mod again and maybe the punishment that my ocd fears was asked!

I cant remember this ""what if scenario"" but it is the reason why I worry. And if I think about the fact that in 2019 I labeled that mod as, lets say, ""ocd potentially dangerous"", I get worried more. If I ignore the whole labeling thing, and I try to think about this, WITHOUT being influenced by the labels, I can understand that is something that there is no need to worry about. If I think about the fact that I labeled it like ocd potential dangerous, I get worried more.

And if in case there was an ocd promise about that mod, what was exactly, about? never play that game using that mod? Yesterday, I did not play that game using that mod, I just, saw the thumbnail of youtube video that had its sequel (not the same game) with a mod. Does that break the hypothetical, ocd promise?

What if my words were different (if in case I made such a promise) and made the promise to count for even watching a thumbnail of a modded sequel of the game that I worry about?

I cant remember making a promise. I think, I just, remember connecting, generally, that mod with my ocd fear of punishment. No promise. just intrusive thoughts. Maybe thats what I remembered in 2019, and decided that is something that needs ocd attention. If it was not for 2019, then I would not worry. My ocd tells me what if in 2019 I could remember more about it and that was the reason that I labeled it as ""ocd potentially dangerous""?

I think, if I remember all these details, then, I remember my way of thinking in 2019. and if I remember nothing about a promise now, then, I probably, never remembered a promise in 2019. So, its just, a false what if scenario. but, is it right?"

religion,kq8c8p,I bought a reddit account because I want to share my worry.,"In 2017, I was playing a pc game and used a mod for it. I think, in the future, when ocd fear of punishment from God appeared, I somehow, connected that mod with my ocd fear. Maybe, just random, intrusive thoughts.

In 2018, ocd promises appeared in order to fight ocd compulsions. There was almost, one time that the specific ocd fear of punishment was asked in case breaking a promise. I canceled the promise but I think, I never broke it.

In 2019, I was trying to see which ocd promises-compulsions, should be kept, no matter what! One of these ocd promises compulsions, was to avoid that mod from that pc game. I do not why I put it as, lets say, ""ocd potentially dangerous"" in my mind's list.

Yesterday, I was on youtube and my mouse pointer went to the thumbnail of a video that automatically, started playing in its small window. The video was about the SEQUEL of that game that I used mod in the past. And the video was about a mod for that sequel. I freaked and got worried. I was a little angry with my bad luck. I think, I wanted to look the thumbnail again, either to confirm that it was what I thought/read it was or either to persuade my ocd that THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. So, I looked at the thumbnail. I got worried more. Instead of avoiding looking it again, I looked it again because I thought that will calm me down. Maybe I thought that by avoid looking at it, will make my ocd worry more.

So, now I worry because ocd tells me that I may have broken a promise to Gods in which a punishment was asked in case breaking it. I cant remember making such a promise for that mod, but I worry becase in 2019, I labeled, lets say as something potentially, dangerous.

If, I ignore the fact that in 2019 I labeled it as I labeled it, and I try to remember if I ever made such a promise, I remember nothing and I come to a conclusion that I probably, never made a ""dangerous"" promise. Probably, only, just old, random, intrusive thoughts that connected it with my ocd fear. And since, my ocd has to do with promises, my ocd (FALSELY) connected it with a scary promise to Gods.

I analyzed it a lot yesterday. I think, the reason that I worry is because in 2019, my ocd labeled that mod as something dangerous. I tried to understand why. I think, I have one explanation. I think, ocd promises appeared in 2018. In 2018, the only dangerous promise that I remember was the promise that I canceled in the end and never broke. In 2019, I tried to remember a promise BEFORE that dangerous promise. Probably, my mind went to 2017 (when the general ocd fear of punishment appeared) and somehow, I remembered me playing that modded game and probably, having some intrusive thoughts about it.

Maybe at that moment, some new intrusive thoughts popped up about making a promise to God to play that game. Maybe I ended up in a dilema and I decided to make a new promise that I will NOT play/use that mod again and maybe the punishment that my ocd fears was asked!

My faith, like others, has many things I agree with and many things I don't agree with. I begin to wonder how can there be such things in my religion if it is supposed to be the word of a prophet or God? Today, many things in holy books are being proved false by advancing science or being given a scientific reason rather than a miracle which further increases my doubts. And there's always the thought of nihilism lingering in the back of my mind that seizes such opportunities. Especially when my mind is empty because what they say is true ""an empty mind is a devils workshop"" but why is that true? Does this mean that if I give religion my concentrated thoughts and try to logically analyze it, I will come to the conclusion that religion is false, there is no god and life doesn't have a meaning or nihilism? I'm afraid of that. So please help me by giving me hope or proving me wrong."

Most of us live through our life in the kindergarten of religion. We are sincere and devoted to our God, but we blindly follow rituals and go round and round in circles.

While all religions are good, and we don't need to change our religion, if we truly love God, we must go beyond religion. We must go beyond kindergarten to graduate in the university of spirituality. We must realize that our own Spirit, our Soul is none other than the Divine. God is not a statue or a saint. As kids, we may believe this, but we must evolve as we grow and go beyond this. We must realize that God is a Power that is within. Our ultimate goal is to realize this truth and to be liberated and unite with the Divine."
religion,kq4mo2,The reason I doubt Christianity," I used to be a Christian and I think I still, I am but not so much. Ocd led me to doubt Jesus. So, I am wondering why Christianity is the one true religion and all other religions are false?  Did Christianity spread through wars? If Christianity was spread because of the fear of hell and the hope of salvation and through wars, I find it very logical to be so popular. Islam is popular too, does that make it as the right and true way to God? I cant understand why I should have faith just because Christianity was spread to many people and that here are many texts written by many people.  How do I know that those people who claimed to write the word of God, were not liars? How do I know that they were not 2 conspiracies, and that The first conspiracy wrote the Old Testament and the other wrote the New Testament? Some may even find similarities between religions as if people are trying to form a way to understand God or Gods. If there were people who doubted Jesus even though they have seen Him then, how are we supposed to believe? I can understand that the message was spread but how do I know that it is not a lie? Islam was spread, too. Why Christians reject Islam? What if Christianity gave people hope and the fear of hell and was spread with war and many people were brainwashed from fear and that created a brainwashed tradition that is still, spreading?"

religion,kpzqd9,Raison d’etre of Image Worship,"Hinduism is often dubbed as idolatrous by its critics If idolatry is sin as believed by the Abrahamic faiths each would get the taint to some extent. The crucifix is commonly used as a symbol of faith by the Christians. The consecrated bread and wine of the Eucharist are considered valid physical symbols. The Catholics make a superfluous distinction between idolatry and the veneration of images. While pagan images in stone, metal, wood or other stuff are ridiculed for being the work of man’s hands, icons works depicting the supreme savior or Christian saints are reverenced. In orthodox Christianity, worship in the form of latreia is prohibited but veneration to holy pictures is allowed. Miracles continue to be associated with the statues of Jesus and Mary. The holy custom of changing robes of the image of ‘the child of praque’ in Carmelite Church comes closer to Hindu temple rituals. Islam disdains the worship of religious figures represented in art but the tombs of saints are frequented by devotees. Image worship is abhorred because it is said to bestow on a creature the reverence due to god alone. The fact is that man who creates the image and the stuff he uses for it, is the creation of the creator himself. As God made man in His image man attempts to make an image of Him attributing to him the qualities which may signify His presence in the material world.

The image is like a finger raised towards the sky – a pointer to the higher form of being. The quest for god in human beings wants the formless to be portrayed in form. This precisely explains why the relics of a Buddha, prophet Mohammed or a Christian saint are considered sacred by the devout. The relics remind one of the person to whom they belong, and if they acquire sanctity, the worshipper may have an ecstatic feeling by just viewing them from a distance.

God or the Absolute is beyond the reach of the senses and the mind, A man of high intellect may be able to contemplate on the abstract Reality but an ordinary mind is unable to connect with something which it has not perceived before or which does not have a material form. An idol is not god but a representation of one of His countless attributes. When the form has beauty and grace, is associated with some awe-inspiring fable or myth, endowed with thaumaturgic power through some holy observance and turned into an object of faith, the mind can focus on it with whole-hearted devotion and take a quantum Jump from the sākāra to the nirākara form of God.

An Idol has its aesthetic aspect, its philosophical aspect, its esoteric aspect, its devotional aspect and its historical, mythological or sociological aspect. Each idol has a deep symbolism to it which is meaningful in may respects. Each stands for an ideal viz. the image of Lord Rama signifies dharma; of Hanuman, valour and loyalty, of the mother goddesses, power (śakti); and so on.

The idol is not equated with the Divine. It is like a staircase which helps one to climb but is abandoned as soon as one reaches the target. The fact of immersion (visarjana) of the idols of Lord Ganesha after the prescribed period of worship, is a classic example in this respect. Each image evokes a particular emotion, idea or thought in consonance with its form and character. By the law of Association, an image of the Lord Buddha evokes peace and that of a demon, fear. A figure in the nude evokes baser instinets while that of a saint dissipates it. The sight of even a handkerchief or a pair of spectacles of one’s diseased father reminds, one of him, and may brings tears. The belongings of a husband on tour remind the wife of him. Hinduism applies the law of Remembrance to the matters Divine so that the seeker could shed his feeling of I-ness and feel oneness with him.

The aesthetically-carved image pleases the eyes and goes straight to the heart. Its sacredness penetrates the soul. The devotee begins with faith; faith is transformed into feeling; feeling into emotion, the emotion into awareness and awareness into an undercurrent of consciousness beyond the form of the deity. The subtle vibrations of a consecrated image bring about transformation and inner Joy, as exemplified in the case of the saints of Maharashtra like Nivrittinatha, Jňānadeva Tukārama and others who worshipped god Vitthal in his Pandharpur shrine and of Sri Rāmakrishna who adored the goddess Kālī in the Dakshineśvara temple."

I have a few books in my personal library that are about religion that I am really excited to read. However, they all presuppose that you know/ understand and have intermediate level knowledge of the stories of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and to some extent the New Testament. I didnt grow up religious, and really only know the stories of Genesis and Exodus well. 

Are there any podcasts/lectures/media content/books out there that go through the entire (or at least most of the) Hebrew Bible and give an analysis and historical context for what is going on? I am looking for a more Jewish perspective than a Christian one. If it then goes to the New Testament, that would be great too! It would be best if it were media content rather than a physical book, but a book would be great too! Emphasis on having historical context.

An example of something that I love is Jordan Peterson's Biblical Series Bible Talks, but they stop at Joseph, which is really early on in the Hebrew Bible. I also really like Dennis Pragers ""Rational Bible"" books. Bible commentary suggestions are welcome, although sometimes those are a bit hard to slog through. I do have the Jewish Study Bible, which is a little more than what I'm looking for.

Hinduism contains similar stories to Greek/Norse gods, tales that show the gods having human characteristics, making decisions that end up biting them in the ass. Stories of what the gods of war did, a married pair of gods and their relationship, playful/sneaky gods. Like Mt Olympus, locations such as trees or rivers are considered holy because a hindu god supposedly did something significant there and yet there is no definitive proof or signs of Hindu gods present on those trees or rivers.

Hinduism contains stories written by man and stories that were passed down to generations through word of mouth, tales similar to the moralistic fables of Aesop

So what makes Hinduism so different from the mythologies? Could anyone explain why Hinduism has managed to retain such a large following while other polytheistic religions have faded, is it something to do with the attitude/culture of the peoples in the Indus valley?"

Religion has stories of deities and figures returning or appearing after they've died. Urban myths also relate ghosts or loved ones appearing.

I've been mulling over the whole concept of everything, and I believe I've come up with a theory that ties together all religion and science.

But one factor that's slightly perplexing - and worrying - is if the afterlife is such a vital component (even, say, Buddhism which appears more nihilistic) in religion, where the heck are all those who 'passed over'?

Are they unable? Not allowed? Just not interested?

Considering MILLIONS of souls have died, you'd think there would be more people receiving messages of comfort or proof of the afterlife.

religion,kotg5w,Parents don't approve of my new girlfriend because she does gymnastics," Just in need of some opinions and advice on what to do

Long story short, my parents are very religious. When I was 12, they spoke to me about sexual purity and stuff from a very religious perspective, Christianity to be exact. It was a little cringy, but I survived lol. Fast forward to now, and I'm 17 years old. Have a friend who I've become close with from a school club, and after a few months, we began to talk about dating. However, after posting on FaceBook about us becoming official, I talked to my parents (out of respect) on the same day (recently), and they were happy for me, but asked to know a little more about her. I showed them her FaceBook and Instagram, only because they asked. Didn't think too much of it; she's a modest person lol. However, there are some photos of her gymnastics training and such, and my parents aren't crazy about her posting photos/images of her in a leotard (with shorts most of the time tho) and ""doing provocative things with her legs"", aka splits, to quote them directly. They continued, saying how a girlfriend should ""respect herself and you"" by ""not showing so much on social media""

They want to meet her soon, and now I regret showing them/telling them anything. I'm almost certain they'll bring it up to her, along with examples of how people from church wear t-shirts at pool parties to be ""modest among their Christian brethren"" and whatnot. Personally, I go to church, but I'm not very passionate/religious personally. She isn't religious either, and I don't want my parents to push their religious beliefs on her when she's not a part of their family and shouldn't have to pretend to be.

Do you have any advice on how to avoid this awkward situation that'll probably come off as weird and viewing a sport as wrongfully sexual and a portrayal of her character/morals?"

religion,kornk9,Monotheistic Base,"The Rigveda speaks not only of the unity of gods but also of the organic unity of the entire existence. The ‘hymn of man’ (purusha sukta) delineates the heavens, the earth, planets, gods, living and non-living objects as the limbs of one great person who pervades the world and yet remains beyond it and inexhaustible. The characteristic of Vedic thought is that each god, when spoken of, is extolled as the supreme God, the creator of the universe and the lord of all gods. This led Prof Max Mueller to infer that Hinduism developed from polytheism through henotheism to monotheism. The fact, however, is that the Vedic religion has, from the beginning, a monotheistic orientation as evidenced by a number of hymns. ‘The One Reality is described by the wise in different ways’ (ekam sad viprā bahudā vadanti-Rig, I, clxiv, 46). ‘He is one without a second’ (ekamevadvityam-chandogya Upanisad, Vi, ii, 1), ‘All this verily is brahman’ (sarvam khalvidam brahme – chandogya, III, XIV, 1). Hindu cults like Śākta, Śaiva, Vaishnva, Saura and Ganapatya, though worshipping different deities, are at bottom, based on the concept of one supreme God. When the Azhvārs sing the glory of Vishnu, Nāyan(m)ars of Śiva, Vārkarīs of vitthal and Dhārkarīs of Rāma, they speak of the same God."

One day I was checking out a customer who was a preacher, we started talking and he told me  a story about one of his church members that was on her death bed and went to her home to comfort her and the family. He noticed that women kept looking at something in the room and he asked her what she was looking at. She told he she saw an angel, he asked her to to describe it. She said the angel was a male extremely tall and very handsome, she laughed after she said the handsome part.The preacher wanted his son to experience this so he said he was going to get his son, who was not far away. When they came back he asked the women where was the Angel now? She replied that the angel was standing right behind his son. The boy was scared and he moved away from the Angel. The women died with a smile on her face. I believe in angels, I never saw one but I know my guardian Angel is with me."

That got me thinking about how I’ve never heard a person who was not raised in one of the three abrahamic religions  talking about god taking to them. This could just be because I’ve never been immersed in a non abrahamic religion based culture.  That was my first thought until a google search brought up millions of hits about taking to the god of the Old Testament but nothing about any other gods. 
The Bible itself if full of examples of people hearing the voice of god which sets a precedent i think for explaining voices, but what about other religions and faiths? Is talking to god a thing in non abrahamic religions?"

My church is an atheist who helps an elderly woman to be safe in the pandemic, it's a Christian who shares his Christmas meal with a homeless, it's a Muslim who fights for women's rights, it's a Hindu who helps children escape prostitution, it's a Buddhist who cares for a foreigner...

My church is not misogynist, it does not condemn those who are different, it respects the particular beliefs of others. It considers that all people are equal in rights, status and dignity. My church prefers peace over conflict, gives love and rejects hate, is merciful and generous, always giving a hand to those in need.

religion,koh59g,God did not create religion," God did not create religion, man created religion. In earlier civilizations, when man was helpless, he looked up at the sky and appealed to a power greater than him, and thus, man realized the presence of God. When man wanted something that he could not achieve, he looked at God to make the impossible possible. When man was dying he looked at God. When there was drought or floods, he looked at God, and this praying to God, got organised into religions. There was no doubt that man of the ancient civilizations accepted that a power existed that created the sun, the moon, the stars, the birds, the animals, and the flowers, and that man of ancient civilizations bowed down, turned to prayer which was formulated into religions."

________________________________________________________________________

So, my Main Point is right there in the Post Title: ‘Can A Woman’s “Derriere”/*Butt* truly be worshiped as “A God” by someone?

Meaning, can a devoted individual look at a certain woman’s certain *”Butt”* (sorry…) and see their salvation, creation, and their “Divine Spiritual God” in it?
CAN one interpret a particular Female’s…”Behind” as a Deity? And not just “a deity”, but a***THE*** Deity? As their chosen Pious-Path of Deliverance?

At the moment, I’m still a little to embarrassed/shy to go into detail as to what prompted me to make this Thread, but I can tell you, with complete sincerity, it’s coming from a place of earnest curiosity. From what all we know about religion &amp; personal beliefs,  and all the “flexibility” that comes with, **CAN** a specific Female’s Buttocks truly be worshipped, and be someone’s God??

Again, I *KNOW* this seems like a Troll-Post. I'm quite aware the people will read this &amp; go: *""...GTFO.""* I fully understand that. But if there might be someone who actually has a ""take"" on this, I'm widely-open to any &amp; all interpretations on this. I need some assurance on this issue, if possible.

religion,kodzec,From drug addict to preacher.,"Hi,  


My friend has been living the life of a good and addict for as long as I can remember.  
I often ended up helping him get his life together, I have helped him menially and financially whenever I could and I tried to get his mind on more positive things he excels at such as music, working out and even though Im not the most religious person I suggested religion because of the good morals that come with it.  


He has been doing good but now he is treating religion like an addiction. Hanging out with people who think they are better than others because they read the bible everyday and go to religious meetings where they insult people who sin.  
My friend is now super judgmental against smoking weed, Gay people and non religious music.  


him and his familly are now holy chosen warriors of God and im the SINNER who doesnt mind if gays marry, who smokes weed and listens to rap.   


How am I the bad influence now? I let him sleep on my couch, I sent money for his kids when him and his girl got into violent arguments, I paid for food when he was starving.   


I will smoke weed if I want to, Jesus drank wine and I cant so boohoo. And when I see a man on the floor begging for something to eat and im high off my devils lettuce, I will stop by and pay for his meal. I hope God sees our actions and considers those who preach but remain judgement as brown noses.

religion,ko9nuq,Gurdjieff on Christianity,"""Once again let us take the idea man. In the language of which I speak, instead of the word 'man,' seven words are used, namely: man number one, man number two, man number three, man number four, man number five, man number six, and man number seven. With these seven ideas people are already able to understand one another when speaking of man.""

""Man number seven means a man who has reached the full development possible to man and who possesses everything a man can possess, that is, will, consciousness, permanent and unchangeable I, individuality, immortality, and many other properties which, in our blindness and ignorance, we ascribe to ourselves. It is only when to a certain extent we understand man number seven and his properties that we can under­ stand the gradual stages through which we can approach him, that is, understand the process of development possible for us.""

""Man number six stands very close to man number seven. He differs from man number seven only by the fact that some of his properties have not as yet become permanent. Man number five is also for us an unattainable standard of man, for it is a man who has reached unity. Man number four is an intermediate stage. I shall speak of him later.""

""Man number one, number two, and number three, these are people who constitute mechanical humanity on the same level on which they are born.""

""Man number one means man in whom the center of gravity of his psychic life lies in the moving center. This is the man of the physical body, the man with whom the moving and the instinctive functions constantly outweigh the emotional and the thinking functions.""

""Man number two means man on the same level of development, but man in whom the center of gravity of his psychic life lies in the emotional center, that is, man with whom the emotional functions outweigh all others; the man of feeling, the emotional man.""

""Man number three means man on the same level of development but man in whom the center of gravity of his psychic life lies in the intellectual center, that is, man with whom the thinking functions gain the upper hand over the moving, instinctive, and emotional functions; the man of reason, who goes into everything from theories, from mental considerations.""

""Every man is born number one, number two, or number three. Man number four is not born ready-made. He is born one, two, or three, and becomes four only as a result of efforts of a definite character. Man number four is always the product of school work. He can neither be born, nor develop accidentally or as the result of ordinary influences of bringing up, education, and so on. Man number four already stands on a different level to man number one, two, and three; he has a permanent center of gravity which consists in his ideas, in his valuation of the work, and in his relation to the school. In addition his psychic centers have already begun to be balanced; one center in him cannot have such a preponderance over others as is the case with people of the first three categories. He already begins to know himself and begins to know whither he is going.""

""Man number five has already been crystallized; he cannot change as man number one, two, and three change. But it must be noted that man number five can be the result of right work and he can be the result of wrong work. He can become number five from number four and he can become number five without having been four. And in this case he cannot develop further, cannot become number six and seven. In order to become number six he must again melt his crystallized essence, must intentionally lose his being of man number five. And this can be achieved only through terrible sufferings. Fortunately these cases of wrong development occur very rarely.""

""The division of man into seven categories, or seven numbers, explains thousands of things which otherwise cannot be understood. This division gives the first conception of relativity as applied to man. Things may be one thing or another thing according to the kind of man from whose point of view, or in relation to whom, they are taken.""

""In accordance with this, all the inner and all the outer manifestations of man, all that belongs to man, and all that is created by him, is also divided into seven categories.""

""It can now be said that there exists a knowledge number one, based upon imitation or upon instincts, or learned by heart, crammed or drilled into a man. Number one, if he is man number one in the full sense of the term, learns everything like a parrot or a monkey.v

""The knowledge of man number two is merely the knowledge of what he likes; what he does not like he does not know. Always and in everything he wants something pleasant. Or, if he is a sick man, he will, on the contrary, know only what he dislikes, what repels him and what evokes in him fear, horror, and loathing.v

""The knowledge of man number three is knowledge based upon subjectively logical thinking, upon words, upon literal understanding. It is the knowledge of bookworms, of scholastics. Men number three, for example, have counted how many times each letter of the Arabic alphabet is repeated in the Koran of Mohammed, and upon this have based a whole system of interpretation of the. Koran.""

""The knowledge of man number four is a very different kind of knowledge. It is knowledge which comes from man number five, who in turn receives it from man number six, who has received it from man number seven. But, of course, man number four assimilates of this knowledge only what is possible according to his powers. But, in comparison with man number one, man number two, and man number three, man number four has begun to get free from the subjective elements in his knowledge and to move along the path towards objective knowledge.""

""The knowledge of man number five is whole, indivisible knowledge. He has now one indivisible I and all his knowledge belongs to this I. He cannot have one I that knows something which another does not know. What he knows, the whole of him knows. His knowledge is nearer to objective knowledge than the knowledge of man number four.v

""The knowledge of man number six is the complete knowledge possible to man; but it can still be lost. The knowledge of man number seven is his own knowledge, which cannot be taken away from him; it is the objective and completely practiced knowledge of All. ""It is exactly the same with being. There is the being of man number one, that is, the being of a man living by his instincts and his sensations; the being of man number two, that is to say, the being of the sentimental, the emotional man; the being of man number three, that is, the being of the rational, the theoretical man, and so on. It is quite clear why knowledge cannot be far away from being. Man number one, two, or three cannot, by reason of his being, possess the knowledge of man number four, man number five, and higher. Whatever you may give him, he may interpret it in his own way, he will reduce every idea to the level on which he is himself.""

""The same order of division into seven categories must be applied to everything relating to man. There is art number one, that is the art of man number one, imitative, copying art, or crudely primitive and sensuous art such as the dances and music of savage peoples. There is art number two, sentimental art; art number three, intellectual, invented art; and there must be art number four, number five, and so on.""

""In exactly the same way there exists the religion of man number one, that is to say, a religion consisting of rites, of external forms, of sacrifices and ceremonies of imposing splendor and brilliance, or, on the contrary, of a gloomy, cruel, and savage character, and so on. There is the religion of man number two; the religion of faith, love, adoration, impulse, enthusiasm, which soon becomes transformed into the religion of persecution, oppression, and extermination of 'heretics' and 'heathens.' There is the religion of man number three; the intellectual, theoretical religion of proofs and arguments, based upon logical deductions, considerations, and interpretations. Religions number one, number two, and number three are really the only ones we know; all known and existing religions and denominations in the world belong to one of these three categories. What the religion of man number four or the religion of man number five and so on is, we do not know, and we cannot know so long as we remain what we are.""

""If instead of religion in general we take Christianity, then again there exists a Christianity number one, that is to say, paganism in the guise of Christianity. Christianity number two is an emotional religion, sometimes very pure but without force, sometimes full of bloodshed and horror leading to the Inquisition, to religious wars. Christianity number three, instances of which are afforded by various forms of Protestantism, is based upon dialectic, argument, theories, and so forth. Then there is Christianity number four, of which men number one, number two, and number three have no conception whatever.""

""In actual fact Christianity number one, number two, and number three is simply external imitation. Only man number four strives to be a Christian and only man number five can actually be a Christian. For to be a Christian means to have the being of a Christian, that is, to live in accordance with Christ's precepts.""

""Man number one, number two, and number three cannot live in accordance with Christ's precepts because with them everything 'happens.' Today it is one thing and tomorrow it is quite another thing. Today they are ready to give away their last shirt and tomorrow to tear a man to pieces because he refuses to give up his shirt to them. They are swayed by every chance event. They are not masters of themselves and therefore they cannot decide to be Christians and really be Christians.""

""Science, philosophy, and all manifestations of man's life and activity can be divided in exactly the same way into seven categories. But the ordinary language in which people speak is very far from any such divisions, and this is why it is so difficult for people to understand one another.""

""In analyzing the various subjective meanings of the word 'man' we have seen how varied and contradictory, and, above all, how concealed and unnoticeable even to the speaker. himself are the meanings and the shades of meaning created by habitual associations that can be put into a word.""

To most people, religion is a comfort and a peaceful thing. To me, it has been a conflict. Ive always had bad anxiety, and I feel like I have to *know* who God is. It's hard for me to simply put it on faith, because many many claim that faith in the wrong religion is harmful. I converted to Christianity at 15 but recently, at 21, I really don't know what I am. I feel really bothered by the teaching that all those who do not believe in Jesus spend an eternity in hell. It does not seem rational to me that a supreme Being that is entirely benevolent would put 7 billion people on earth, and have the vast majority suffer eternal torment. That being said, I still feel attached to many areas of my old faith. I wish to believe in a God that loves their creation so much, that they understand our walks are confusing and that we can't know everything. A God that does not take someone with the wrong faith as a personal attack on Him, but rather as a fallible creature trying it's best to find truth. One that forgives people and offers chances at redemption regardless of background. Anyway, I feel lost, because I don't think any religions really view God in this way.

religion,knp4h0,"Why should God be worshiped, and why would he want to be?","I'm an agnostic atheist myself, so a lot of the very concept of religion is rather alien to me. One such thing is the reason people have to worship the God of their choice. The religion I've been in contact with most in my life, and am thus most familiar with, is Christianity (in several forms), and so the question is phrased mostly from that context, but if anyone else feels like answering from the context of their own religion, I welcome it. My main goal is to understand people's reasoning in doing what they do.

Now, on to the question at hand: why do you worship God? Even reasoning from a perspective in which God created all of existence, I see no reason to worship him. I don't worship my parents for giving me life. I don't worship J. K. Rowling for writing my favorite book of all time, or Disney for creating my favorite movie of all time (or Shakespeare for creating the story on which that movie is loosely based). Creation, to me, is not a reason for worship. I'm happy to be alive, yes, but if I weren't alive I wouldn't know it anyway. My appreciation of life (or possible lack thereof) has no impact at all on the creator of that life. Why, then, would God be different in that regard? I appreciate the creation, but it certainly doesn't warrant worship, in my view.

Of course, it could be that you worship God because he wants to be worshiped. In that case, why would he want to be? As an omnipotent and omniscient being, it seems odd that he would want the worship of insignificant creatures such as ourselves. If NPCs in a game worship me, that's amusing, but it means nothing to me in the grand scheme of things. They're nothing to me, in the end, and I imagine the difference between an infinitely powerful being and us is even greater still than between us and characters in a game. As I mentioned before, I don't believe having created something entitles the creator to worship, or even gratitude. I don't think creating anything solely for praise is a healthy thing to do, in fact. I write stories because I like doing it, and if someone else ends up liking what I write, then so much the better. If not, fine with me. I don't really think an omnipotent deity would be quite so petty as to demand worship because he created the world. If a human acted like that, no one would take them seriously, and despite not being a believer myself, I do very much think any deity competent enough to create a universe of this complexity would have enough self-esteem to not desperately seek worship from his own creations. It feels almost insulting to think he would, to me.

So, in short, my questions remain these:  
1. Why do you worship God?  
2. Why would God want to be worshiped at all?

I'd like to stress that I'm really not trying to attack anyone's beliefs here; I just very much want to understand the reasoning behind it. If I inadvertently insulted someone, I apologize."

We do not experience suffering when there is physical pain in the body, we do not experience misery of the mind and the agony of the ego. Even if all this happens, it happens only for a moment, because spirituality makes us realize we are the Divine Spirit, the Soul, the Atman. We are deathless, we are birthless, we are a manifestation of the Divine. Spirituality gives us a bliss which is eternal, a peace that is everlasting. Spirituality makes us experience the Divine within, just as we experience God in everybody and in everything. Therefore, spirituality transforms our life completely, but until we go on that path and we realize that we are the Divine Spirit, it may not seem that all this will happen. It is a journey which we must start, then we will experience the bliss of spirituality."

They do not have a fully developed intellect like we human beings have. It is only we human beings who have got an intellect that can understand the meaning of life and death. But even though we have an intellect and even though we are capable of understanding the meaning of death, we don't understand the meaning of death, we don't know what death is, we don't know what happens after death, that’s why we live in constant fear of the unknown and loss of the known at death. We don't realize that death is not the end, it is just a bend. Therefore we human beings also become like other animals and other species without intellect because we don't use our intellect."

religion,kmxqu2,Why can't spirituality be science?," Spirituality is a science, it doesn't ‘have’ to be science. It is the science of the Spirit. Unfortunately we are looking for physical proof. Science doesn't have physical proof for gravity, but why does science accept gravity? It is through inference. When Newtown found an apple falling on his head, he did not say ‘ouch’ like millions of people before him, he asked the question - why? Why did the apple fall down? And he discovered the Law of Gravity. Science accepts it, though there is no proof, it accepts through inference. So is this spirituality - a science by inference. When we infer what happens at death; when we infer why apples don't grow on mango trees, when we infer what is the cause of our birth, we will realize the science of spirituality."

It is well known that in his area the winters get incredibly cold.  So cold that no winter went by without a person losing some family member or friend.  The bible says Jesus was born in the middle of this winter.  That in itself is very doubtful.  Now here's something that has really convinced me that it's not possible.  In the bible it says that there were shepherds watching over their fields at NIGHT.  

Luke 2:8

**7**And she gave birth to her firstborn, a Son. She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. **8**[And](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm) [there were](https://biblehub.com/greek/1510.htm) [shepherds](https://biblehub.com/greek/4166.htm) [residing in the fields](https://biblehub.com/greek/63.htm) [nearby,](https://biblehub.com/greek/5561.htm) [keeping](https://biblehub.com/greek/5442.htm) [watch](https://biblehub.com/greek/5438.htm) [over](https://biblehub.com/greek/1909.htm) [their](https://biblehub.com/greek/846.htm) [flocks](https://biblehub.com/greek/4167.htm) [by night.](https://biblehub.com/greek/3571.htm) **9**Just then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.…

How is it possible for them to be watching over a field that is covered in snow?  And how are they watching it at night?  It's simply not possible.  

Now here's something really interesting.  The only reason it is celebrated on December 25th is because of a PAGAN holiday that took place on the winter solstice.  Rome decided to use this day to celebrate it.  I feel like Jesus wouldn't be happy about that at all."

Your first reaction is shock and disbelief, and might even think they've gone mental.

religion,kmlmqd,"my current view on the division between religious people and ""the others""."," dear jewish people,

like muslims are expected to distance themselves from terrorist attacks by other muslims, maybe jews could do the same? right now there is a very small group of bad jews and muslims screwing up the reputations for all of the good ones out there. some say it might be a form of self-sabotage by religious (mis)leaders in order to keep their followers isolated from the others.

that oversized concentration camp called gaza is cousing people all over the world to feel hatred towards jews in general. by not distancing yourselves from this ongoing crime against humanity you are basicly condoning everything the israeli's do. all this intens hatred couses the world to distance themselves from jewish people with social/financial isolation as a result. instead of mixing with others and have fun, jews are being used as piggy banks only to get harvested by churges after death. like pretty much every religious institution in the world, the jewish religion can only survive with money from dead people. one can imagine the temple would not appreciate jews all over the world spending ""their"" money on cool stuff and have fun.

9/11 was a good reason to invade and destabilise the middle-east and prevent those countries from uniting against israel.

exactly like the holocaust was a good reason for european jews to start hating europeans for not doing anything to stop it.

denying the holocaust is illigal but what about claiming that it was a very effective way to isolate european jews from others? i cannot believe i am about to say this in public but for a selective few the holocaust was the best thing that ever happened. obviously those were not the people that were enslaved to death in those camps where they teached people how to focus. it were the ones that bought themselves a one-way ticket to the united states of america, long before the war started.

He became so tied to that god thay began to persecute the cult of other gods and to make Aten basically the only god to be worshipped.

religion,klsj6a,Coincidences that caused me anxiety. Could these be signs?,"I have ocd. My ocd has to do with promises to God or Gods. The reason of the promises were to force myself to stop do an ocd compulsion.

For example, if my ocd is telling me to do a compulsion, I make the promise about not doing the compulsion and a punishment/curse was being asked in order to use the fear of the punishment/curse to force myself not to do the compulsion.

One time, I told God that I would mean a promise only if I validated it by doing the cross sign 3 times because I think I was telling Him that I do not mean those promises and I make them because of my ocd. One time, I tried to validate a promise but I think, I stopped validating by stoping to the second time of the cross sign. The reason of the validation was because ocd kept giving me worries and just by thinkiing the promise did not work. Anyway, I think I stopped at second time and canceled the promise.

I am not sure if the promise was canceled. now, I have some other fears and worries too.

1) what if the promises/deals were accepted by other Gods in case Christian God is not real?

2) what if there are promises/deals that I do not remember?

3) my mind has intrusive thoughts about making new deals/promises to Gods and almost, every 1 minute or 30 seconds I pray compulsively in my head to explain that I do not make promises.

I feel depressed. I cant be free. Whenever I am in my computer, I am worrying that I will see something or say something that will break a promise or an hypothetical promise.

When I am not in my computer, my mind is having intrusive thoughts. I get so tired and anxious sometimes that probably, makes my system not work properly. I get prostate pain and my bowels probably, do not work properply. Sometimes, I lose my sleepy mood because of it.

I pay much attention to this ocd issue, because 2,5 years ago, I started witnessing some coincidences that I connected them as a bad sign from Christian God.

Can these be considered as negative signs from Christan God or other Gods? I used to believe in Jesus but now, I am lost. I am writing some coincidences that happened in the past.

1) I was in my bed, 2 years ago. I asked from God a specific sign to happen, if in case, lets say, my ocd is right. I asked something like if my ocd is right, to hear a door opening/closing in the building that I used to live, then. The sound in order to be considered as a sign, should be heard til 5 seconds pass, since I ask it. If the sound happens after 6 or more seconds, it wont be considered as a sign. I asked for that sign and even though, I changed my opion about it due to a possible coincidence, I heard someone unlocking his/her door apartment. it was before the 5-second rule. Since, then, I would find myself between sleep and awake, and I would have the very first thought of the day. Randomly, with my eyes still closed from sleep, I was having random thoughts like "" door sound, i will hear a door"" etc. And after some 5-10 seconds, I would hear a door. That happened more than 5 times, I guess. It was as if my mind was predicting that i will hear a door. It was not a dream. I suppose, my subconscious was scared by the door coincidence, and in my sleep, I would hear sounds that are similar to door. For example, even calling the elevator would sound as a heavy door closing. If someone unlocks his/her door aparment and then, closes the door, I would hear it in my sleep and get the random thought ""door sound, door sound"" then, I would hear the man/woman calling the elevator which sounds like a door closing with force, so, I guess that created the misunderstanding that I was predicting a door sound, every morning.

​

​

2) I was praying and had my eyes closed. In the blackness, I was thinking about my ocd fear and that, created an image. That image was a japanese monster that I watched, randomly, on internet days ago. I opened my eyes, and started looking random stuff in facebook. After 5-10 minutes, I saw an article about that monster that it popped in my mind while I was praying. it was the first time, that I saw it on facebook.

​

​

3) I was watching a video. the guy was talking about a symbol. I heard him saying the word sign, but was not sure. I decided to close the video because my mind started thinking stuff like "" I will hear it again and it will be a bad, scary coincidence, i better close it"" I wa ready to close the site but my new thoughts stopped me. I was thinking "" what if when i close the video, I will hear the guy saying the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing the video? that would be scary"" I just wanted to close the video because I did not want to hear the word ""sign"" and when I tried to close it, i stopped because I feared that I would hear the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing it. So, I waited some seconds in order for the guy to somehow, change the subject and when I felt that it was the right moment to close it, I closed it, very fast, and uninentionally, without knowing that he will say the word ""sign"" I closed it with him saying the word ""sign"" as the last word. It was so unlikely to happen. The guy was speaking fast. If I had closed the video 1 second earlier, I would never have heard it. But I was so unlucky that I closed it randomly, when he was saying the word ""sign"" I know he said that word because I op How my mind predicted that I would hear the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing the video? I checked it and the guy indeed was saying the word ""sign"" and I am worried because if I have closed the video 1 second earlier or later, this scary coincidence would never happen. how you explain that?

​

​

4) A coincidence happened in youtube, with a video game character from Mortal Kombat, known as Scorpion. He transformed to a scorpion and i do not remember, exactly but that generated a random thought like "" I guess, Scorpion will give me some worries about my whole ocd-coincidence case"" I was playing Mortal Kombat 4 after a very long time, and the first opponent was Scorpion. I lost the match, and it the moment that Scorpion was to give me the finishing strike. I got a random thought like "" i hope he wont transform to a scorpion"" and he did! first match and he transformed to a scorpion. i was playing against the computer. there are many other moves that could computer use in order to finish me, and the computer choose to transform to a scorpion. that is not so common when playing against a computer. I fought him again and lost again. I was thinking "" I hope he does not transform to a scorpion 2 times in a row because that would be very rare"" and yes, he transformed to a scorpion again. 2 times in a row! I was watching a youtube video with a collection of all mortal kombat finishing moves. It was about 1 or 2 hours. I randomly, clicked the timeline in a random second. It was the second that the Scorpion character was transforming to a scorpion! That was about 7 seconds. So, from all 60-120 minutes of the video, I randomly, clicked on the 7-second scene of scorpion?

​

​

5) My ocd fear is about asking punishment from God so i was thinking about a similar example. I was thinking that if someone would have asked from God to lose his arm in an accident, that would never happen. that calmed me down but 1 minute later, I saw someone in the street with one arm only. was that a sign from God to tell me that I should be afraid of what my ocd says?

​

​

6) I ended up having random sound coincidences with other daily sounds, similar to the door sound. Like car alarms and dog barking. I would be thinking about my ocd and then, I would have random thoughts like "" i hope i wont hear a door or a dog or a car alarm"" and yes, i would hear one of these things. many times. I would be writing about the door coincidence in the internet and I would get a random thought like ""I hope i wont hear a door sound, now tha i am writing the word ""door"" because that would be a scary"" and yes, i was hearing a door sound.

​

7) I was having a scary thought for many days. i was thinking ""what if one day, I hear these 3 sounds (dog,alarm,door) together? that would be super scary"" One day, i was thinking about my ocd and randomly, a dog barked. I thought "" just a dog, i would be scared only if it was the 3 sounds together"" the dog kept barking for a minute and suddenly, I hear a car alarm ringing the same time with the elevator sound. The elevator sound, sounds like a heavy door closing so, it can be considered as the 3 sounds happening together. I was in a different neighborhood, and I heard a car alarm the same time with a door opening/closing in the building. i remembered the 3-sound coincidence and I was like "" the only thing we miss now is a dog"" and a dog started barking.

​

8) I was writing many times, on internet, about these coincidences. One afternoon, a friend that knows nothing of my problem, send me a spam message. he wanted to complain that I always cancel when we arrange something. the message was like

"" Coincidences are good but is it a coincidence that I agree? everytime we arrange to go out, you cancel it, is that a coincidence""

I freaked! why he randomly, used the word ""coincidence""

​

9) An internet user, suggested me 3 books related to my ocd problem, somehow. I was not interested in these books and as I was ready to close the site, i got a thought like ""what if there is a sign hidden in these books? choose one of them"" I randomly, searched one of the three books, for its summary in wikipedia. The ending was almost, 80% my ocd fear and the summary was using words-phrases that I used to describe my ocd fear. was that a coincidence? my mind predicted that I would find something there and then, indeed I found something related to my ocd fear so much?

​

10) A friend of mine was speaking about the thiefs that steal wallets from random people. I was thinking about my ocd fear and got a random thought like "" Perhaps, we are cursed from God"" and at that moment, I hear my friend saying "" the thief curses when he steals a wallet that it is empty due to the economy crisis"" was that a coincidence?

​

11) I read the word ""curse"" on internet and I hear from the tv, which was playing a scooby-doo episode, saying something like "" he was cursed"" i freaked and the tv kept saying "" his worst nightmare came true""

​

12) I entered the room in which the tv was open. It was a show about mythology. The narrator was saying a story. When I walked in the room, I heard the narrator saying "" She cursed herself and the sea and asked from God to be transformed to stone and God granted her wish"" That was my ocd fear! asking a punishment from God. I was writing about that coincidence on the internet and as I was thinking to write "" Was that a coincidence or not"" I hear my grandma saying to my father something like '' these are signs"" was that a coincidence again?

​

13) I was staying in an airbnb apartment. I was looking the bookcase that had a few books. after some time, I looked it again, and had a book with the title ""THE SIGN OF GOD"" i did not freak because it was a time that I started ignoring my ocd and was thinking less about the whole coincidence-thing. But still, why i did not saw that book when I checked for the first time?

14) I was writing about an ocd worry on internet and as I was ready to write the word ""movement"" in greek, I heard an ad saying something like "" bla bla bla bla.... movement"" I got worried and I was wondering if it was a coincidence. At that moment, I heard from the tv, probably, from the next ad, saying something like "" psoriasis signs"" and I freaked because I heard the word signs.

15) I was thinking about my ocd worry and heard a door sound the same time with a dog barking. that reminded me of the dog-door-alarm coincidence, and at that moment, I noticed that I coucld hear the sound of a van sensor/alarm or something similar to that. I do not know if it started when I heard the door/dog or it started earlier. Anyway, I probably, heard the 3 sounds together again.

16) I ended up connecting as a bad sign, a butterfly. While I was thinking about a small coincidence with a butterfly that I saw in a series episode, I randomly, looked the toilet paper and saw butterflies printed on it.

​

can someone explain to me, what he/she thinks of these coincidences one by one. These coincidences are the reason that I cant just ignore my ocd that easily. Because coincidences happen that perhaps, tell me that my ocd is right and I should worry about it."

Think of every lunatic terrorist/ televangelist/ thieving politician. They all use religion for their justification, or a scare tactic to get money. These people are also susceptible to delusions of grandeur and shocking arrogance; as long as they claim to be a ""man of god"", they can get away with anything, or make any claim. Have you seen the size of some televangelists' houses? Especially compared to what amount they give to charity (none)? I'm convinced most of them are actually atheists using religion as a grift, but that's another post. As an atheist myself, I'd disavow and disown them if they are.

And as for common individuals, they spend their lives thinking ""god's"" going to come back any minute, within their lifetime. They get older, and maybe on a subconscious level realize it's all bullshit. They go crazy; I've seen it happen. They keep thinking these are the last days.

It seems like too weird of a occurance and coincidence. Secondly, someone reported that they would give up their life to return to that one moment. That doesn't sound like a drug effect. I've dabbled in addiction and it's nothing like that or anything else I can discern from ex or current addicts. So, I'm confused on that point. Lucid dreaming could be explained away maybe.

i agree and love and appreciate the sentiment of religion. i think that it is a powerful tool and guide on a robust and full life. i've really come to believe that our Self is our guide, though... and as i'm starting to re-read and listen to sermons and talks by various religious folk, i'm wondering: why is it that we can not trust our selves, but we can trust our faith? why is it that we need a representative for our sins or even our good deeds? we often can't (or don't) take accountability for either and i wonder why? why can we not see our selves as god? i realize that sounds self serving, but... we control our selves, no? what's the difference between adhering to rules sent forth by deity rather than just adhering to the same rules because they are for the good of all people? tell me what i'm missing and if i'm being naive. i truly have been thinking about this difference a LOT.

this is all a very brand new thought to me and i do not! mean to be offensive or hurtful in any way. i think that religion is a wonderful tool for community and philanthropy and philosophy, but i sometimes worry that it falls short in literal practice.

religion,klexqf,"What ""god"" truly is...","I’d like to share a thought experiment I read in an excellent philosophy book a few months ago.


Imagine two armies going to war and wishing “god” is on their side.
Perfect justice is only found in neutrality, so “god” is on both sides and this equals being on none. Perfection means that “god” never takes one side more than another, and with simple logic we see that omnipresence and perfection walk together. It becomes clear how “god” is already the essence within everything.


The book also explains how “god” is a nondual concept, meaning you can never answer the question about its existence with either yes or no. Choosing one or the other always leaves holes, which we already see from all the different and confusing views everyday in the world. We only have duality (either yes or no) in imperfection. If you answer it with both yes and no… Just as it is both “alpha and omega”, then you have the correct answer. God both exists and does not exist at the same time. Because perfection is restricted to neutrality... “yes” to everything is also the same as “no” to everything.


There's also a funny part in the book which states that ""god"" is so perfect it makes everyone right about it (albeit partial and incomplete). Distributing all sorts of ""salvation"" and ""punishment"" that the whole system should require. And that if you think something infinite can do that, you are selfish and trying to put ""god"" in a box that is convenient for you (which will never work).


This also supports all sorts of “heavens”, “hells” and an infinite number of other planes being real. That even if you sum all religions on Earth it still wouldn’t be enough to describe the infinity of what “god” is (and it could still inspire an infinite number of different religions)... the beginning and end of everything. Another interesting part says that the definitions of ""heaven"" and ""hell"" are subjective, and that we see the same ""ignorant patriotism"" of different countries: Everything that is not my ""heaven"" is ""hell"". That it's all just different planes and the right approach would be travelling through many to become a more fulfilled being just as we should travel the world.


Anyway, this is the book... and I highly recommend reading it:

religion,kleqro,Is Christianity considered idolatory?,"Hello everyone :) hope you’re doing well. 

I’m a Christian and have been a Christian for over 22 years. 

Recently I’m going through a tough time and met a Muslim guy who became my friend. 

He spent hours telling me the following: 
- That Christianity is idolatory 
- That I should convert to Islam and being rather forceful about this 
- That Jesus is not the son of God, and telling me that he is the result of incest 
- That there was no way for God to steal another man’s wife (Mary) to impregnate her to give birth to Jesus 
- That Muslim culture is better compared to Christian culture in terms of marriage 

While I respect his viewpoints I’m just wanting other people’s opinions on this. I’ve been a Christian for so long so I’m a bit reluctant to convert to Islam. Is what he is saying really true? For me personally I’m more focussed on my relationship with God rather than focussing on which religion/faith is wrong or right.

religion,klc4am,I Think religion is harmful to society,"I'm not sure if this is right right place for this, apologies if it isn't, rules said debates where OK and that is what I am aiming to start. As someone who has been raised in a (fairly) religious family my whole life and made the desicion to be athiest about 6 years ago, I have come to my conclusion that religion is harmful to society as a whole as well as individual people. These opinions are from my own observations though I will aim to provide sources if asked. This I probably going to be a long one so the tl:Dr is the title, sorry for essay like format, it just kind of ended up like that since I just got out of a Re essay.                                                                                 First I think that it harms individual   by  removing their ability to think critically. This is due to the fact that religion relies very heavily on 'faith' and not empirical evidence or observations that can be made by people in day to day life (which is different to things like gravity in science which can be clearly seen just by dropping something). Because of this general lack of evidence through my time being Christian I was told constantly 'have faith' and 'God works in mysterious ways'. This consistent lack of proof leads to people who follow religions accepting things they see without proof and often things which are radical like religion (evidence to this can be seen with many groups such as anti-maskers or flat earthers) . I can think of many other ways that that it harms the individual person but I'll try to keep the size down.                                                                                  A way that I think that it harms people on a societal level is by giving them an excuse to commit countless atrocities. How many terrorist attacks have been committed with the excuse that God told me to do it? I of corse don't think that every religious person would be a terrorist and I'm sure that the people who are terrorist have things other than religion motivating them, but I think that other examples can be seen that are less severe (in my opinion). For years racism, homophobia and other types of hate have been motivated by religion (again not for everybody but for many), specifically by the Bible, which says things that encourage this kind of hate frequently. I'm sure I don't even need to mention how religion has been used in the East to promote sexism and in the west to let Catholic priests get a way with molesting children. Again I feel I would be able to provide many more reason but its getting really long now, please give me your opinions in the comments and I will try to reply and give sources where asked for ."

Of the, approximately, 150,000 years that we’ve been anatomically human, we’ve only had “civilization” for 10,000 years; and, of those 10,000 years, we’ve only been using philosophy for 2,500 years; and of those 2,500 years, we’ve only been using science, as we would recognize it, for, maybe, 1000 years; and the most change in all of human history has taken place in the last 300 years. To hold onto the Bible as the word of a deity, is to hold onto the archaic, and mostly legendary, past. Religion has had a privileged position at the top of just about every society for the last 10,000 years; it’s no surprise that, only after the rise of modern science do we see a sharp and unprecedented increase in our technological and scientific knowledge. It’s time for rational skepticism, reason, and humanism to take their rightful place at the top of the societal hierarchy; because, based on the evidence, they deserve it much more than religion ever did.

“Well, the entire Old Testament is pretty much a comedy of god’s errors and anger. He creates two people, sticks them in a garden, In the most absurd situation, says don't eat from this tree; I realize that he was probably a first time parents in this scenario, but I think even the dumbest parent would know what was going to happen there. And so he has to punish them and exile them, and then the whole world goes to hell shortly thereafter; and so he picks out the most righteous man and his family and decides to build a ridiculous boat – which isn't seaworthy and couldn't hold all the animals –  and he’s going to flood and kill everything except for this family  (at least if you go for a global flood, which we know, scientifically, just is absurd; and no other civilizations seemed to notice this global flood, so it must have been a local flood, which doesn't actually solve the problem of sin). And then right after Noah you've got a couple hundred years where they do this massive population growth and they're building a tower of Babel – which I don't know why God would be even the slightest bit bothered. This was clearly the mindset of these ancient people, that God lived somewhere up in the sky; even though modern theologians say, ‘no that that's not it at all, because clearly we travel to the moon.’ I don't know if we wave to God on the way past – and that fails and falls apart. So, then God decides instead of trying to save everyone, he's just going to pick out his one favorite tribe, who happened to be enslaved - and I'm pretty sure they should have realized that there was a problem with slavery – and It goes through this incredible scenario of: we're gonna give all these plagues and everytime pharaoh wants to actually let them go, God comes down and specifically hardens his heart, so that he can show off a bit more ‘Oh no no no no I want you to let them go, but I'm not gonna let you make that...’ – he violated pharaoh's free will. It's explicitly there. He hardened pharaoh's heart so he couldn't do it, gets all the plagues out of the way, then these 3 million Jews – for which there is no evidence that were ever enslaved in Egypt – … they’re led across, you know, all these miracles and everything else, miracles that would wow anybody living today, they get to the Mount Ararat, Moses is gone for 40 days and those guys say ‘ahhh screw that God, we’ll make another one.’ This guy can't do anything right, and yet he specifically chose this universe, where he knew he was going to have to keep fail and keep killing and keep failing and keep killing, until he picked out his little special group and set them around to keep failing and keep killing and then, there's this empty period and he decides, ‘you know what, I'm going to take human form, come down, sacrificed myself to myself to act as a loophole for rules that I created that I can't circumvent.’ I mean, it is logically absurd.”

cults,lwesuq,My stalker is one of the founders of QAnon.,"I just joined the forum in order to be able to post about this. The man who has stalked me for the last three years is one of the founders of the QAnon scam. He, like Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys, is the head of an alt right militia -- and himself involved in human trafficking. I am blogging about this situation, because I feel it is so fundamentally dangerous to our democracy. [https://thegodfatherconversations.blogspot.com](https://thegodfatherconversations.blogspot.com/) QAnon adherents have posted about ""the storm,"" in which 100,000 Americans were to have been arrested (on false charges) if Trump had been re-elected. What they don't realize is that those false charges have been ""anchored"" in falsified police reports in law enforcement offices that have been infiltrated by the alt right. I don't want to enter a heated political debate with anyone, honestly. I just want to let you know what I know on the chance that it may help you or someone you love. If you ask questions here, I will do my best to answer them with the information I currently possess. I believe that access to the full truth is the only way out of the QAnon scam. People need to know that they have been manipulated as part of a carefully crafted political ploy of the alt right. Misinformation and democracy cannot co-exist. We, as a society, have to choose one or the other. I hope I can contribute to the preservation of our democracy by revealing what I know. I'm wishing you all the best. I appreciate the fact that you're trying to help your loved ones. Don't give up."

cults,lwb5k1,The theory that I came up with for people searching secret society,"The idea that I came up with that why YouTube says it's people to do not say how much money a particular person makes to avoid youtubers to judge that "" He makes more than me or he makes less then me""
Is very smart but just imagine of youtube's a cult and the people who are getting well paid are the members 
That are supposed to hide there earnings

That means people like pewdiepie are supporting the YouTube platform hasn't every said anything about how much he makes(no hate on him or any other youtuber) 
But it's true with a sub count of over100+ he is the main attraction
Every time they see there networth they say it's less maybe they hiding something. 

It may sound strange like I know I am stupid but what if the triangle cult is real the youtube sysmbol is triangle
The Spotify has a triangle on it's play button the google play has a triangle syscon has a triangle snapchat sent icon has a triangle and more apps has triangles on them 

I got this thing of cults by the means of a student group who was questioning the Pythagorean group or something three trangles etc a cult based on maths the pi sign the T sign some shi 

The main question that poped in my head was that the popular stars daft punk made a fukin triangle famous song makes triangles. 

And now with the red laser eyes popin in every hit song
Songs like martingarrix(who also makes triangle signs no hate on him) made a song always under pressure had lazer eyes and he has a sysmbol of a goat with broken antler or what ever it's called 
WEEKEND used red eyes in it's SUPER BOWL
A popular song 3:49 by divin also contains red lazer eyes

Idk I might be tripping with triangles and red eyes and people who are very intelligent can make something extremely superb like a cult and create an idea of pyramid scheme 
The cycle of food chain is a triangle because it's going up words the APEX WINS the pyramids had gold on it's top to show the that the one on top is the one. 
The DOLLER has a triangle that has a big meaning to it

The rich the powerfull might be in something (not every one but some) called a secret society for those who are ready to sacrifice anything for their wealth 
THEY ONE WHO MAKES SACRIFICES GO AHEAD

To reach the top of the pyramid or one of the top ones you have to make sacrifices of dreams, sleep, time, people, habits. 

At the end there might be or is a secret society based on these things maybe or maybe I just have too much time thinking this and I am cracked in the head 
BUT IT'S A INTERESTING THINK TO THINK allot about 
 
It's fictional but it might be or is true??? 

Any help might be useful so this becomes false??"

cults,lw6ybf,"Turn-About Ranch (Tw: RA, SA)","(Keep in mind, I have not been to TAR, I am just reiterating claims made by the ex-patients who have come forward. Links below.)

Turn-About Ranch is best known for being the recovery / treatment center for troubled youth, promoted regularly by Dr. Phil. The ranch is located in Escalante, Utah, the whole town populated by less than 1,000 people, and it is said to be ""in the middle of nowhere,"" intentionally creating an isolating environment to discourage escapees.

The ranch accepts kids aged 13-17, typically those who have a hard home life, PTSD, struggling with substance abuse, sexual abuse, and so on, so the children getting admitted to this facility are already traumatized beforehand, making what happens there even more damaging.

The program typically last 100 days, and costs the parents $100,000 for that time. There are 4 Levels you must reach in order to graduate, to gain permission to leave, everyone starting at Level 1, working their way up. For the first 3 days, you are meant to stay outside in a teepee from morning until night regardless of weather / temperature, and only come inside to sleep on the floor with a sleeping bag, no pillow or blanket. You need to complete Goals, which are seemingly normal tasks you must complete before moving up a Level, which include Bow Drills, where patients are given a wood bow and kindling nest, and they must make 3 successful fires in order to move forward. Some patients could take weeks or months to complete their Bow Drills, or other such Goals.

After you complete Level 1, the 3 day teepee initiation, you reach Level 2 and you can go in to a building called Roundy. While at this stage, no talking is permitted unless a staff can hear you, you can't leave Roundy at any time unless a staff is with you. No talking back or disobedience in any way, even if whats being asked of you is wrong or immoral. 

Failure to comply with any of the staff warrants punishment, of which includes withholding food (no breakfast or dinner), withholding medicine (including medicine for allergies, cold / flu, asthma, etc.), not allowing shower / bath time, not allowing patients to change clothes, not allowing patients to talk at all. There was a punishment called Reflection where patients were made to sit on a chair facing the wall for hours, not permitted to leave for any reason. It was also commonplace to force patients to eat alll of the food that is given to them, including food they are intolerant to, going as far as to force patients to eat their own vomit if they get sick from the food. All of the patients who have come forward have experienced malnutrition or dehydration to some extent. The food is even prepared to be intentionally gross, serving warm food cold, or cold food warm, touching food with dirty hands before serving, etc.

Other common punishments include having patients sit outside all night in below freezing temperatures with just the clothing on their back. Sometimes you were required to jog laps around the arena until the staff feels like you learned your lesson, which could take literally days, plus not being allowed to shower or change clothes, this often leading to athletes foot, infection, chronic exhaustion, and more.

While this is going on in the background, the ""real treatment"" aside from their Goals, includes making the patients take tests where they answer random trivia questions on animals, farmlife, as well as what you learned being here, and dig into your own self awareness. Scavenger Hunts were common, which could often take weeks or months to complete. If you are well behaved, and answer the tests correctly, you can move to Level 3. Level 3 and Level 4 patients are moved out of Roundy to a place called The Barn, where they tend to animals, namely horses and cattle. Punishments now included scooping manure for hours, spending time in the dirty location for days without any sense of hygiene, intentionally degrading behaviour.

Technically you can graduate at Level 3, but they prefer you get to Level 4 before leaving, and it is not uncommon for the staff to keep patients longer than their 100 days to encourage more progression, making false claims to the parents, claiming the patients need to stay longer for whatever reasons. Also, your graduation date was not to be known to you, that way they could push it back if you misbehave. Graduations were only announced the day of.

Speaking of parents, none of the patients are permitted to call, message, or even write letters to their parents without the message ""being approved"" by one of the staff, and any criticism of the ranch or the staff would result in destruction of the message. Same way coming in, the staff would read your parents messages before giving them to you, and if the messages were not approved, you wouldn't even know someone was trying to reach out to you. Staff could even forge patients' letters to the parents, claiming everything is perfect or that they want to stay longer, making the parents feel like this is good for their childrens' recovery.

Patients were never allowed to say anything critical of the staff, regardless of scenario. One ex-patient, Hannah Archuleta, claims she was sexually assaulted by a male staff member, and when she went to another staff for help, she was met with severe punishments, withholding her food for days, made to stay out in the cold for days, and called a liar to her face, declaring she would get worse punishments if she lied again. The sexual abuse only continued, now being too intimidated to come forward to staff, fearing more punishments, she had to let the torture endure. 

After her graduation, she was able to leave the ranch and immediately sued the ranch for harmful neglect, sexual assault, child endangerment, and much more. Not having much proof, since the ranch only has selective security cameras, and obviously they aren't going to admit to this activity. The patients currently admitted are also much too scared to go against the ranch, fearing retaliation. However, Hannah Archuleta isn't the only one who has come forward about her time at the ranch, as many people have, but most were blown off and ignored, ""since a lot of them have a past with manipulation or lying,"" most people assume they are exaggerating about the abuse that takes place there.

Unfortunately, a patient named Clay Brewer had tried taking his own life at the facility by attempting to drink bleach on numerous occasion, each time being met with severe punishments. One day, the troubled teen beat a staff member to death with a crowbar, in front of other patients. The police were called and the teen was arrested for murder, with very little investigation into what was causing his behaviour, since he was already considered troubled, they didn't bother looking much deeper into his anguish. It is believed that this boy was being sexually abused, physically abused, and denied his medicine, all of which would drive anyone mad.

I believe the patients are made to feel like the deserve what happens to them, and they are essentially brainwashed into silence, and the only way to reach Level 4 is to be completely compliant, and admit that you've learned a lot from this ranch, and even thank the staff for the experience. When you reach Level 4, you are given your own designated water cup. If you left water in your cup unattended, you would get punishments, on top of having cold water thrown at you for being wasteful.

There are two first hand accounts that have recently gained some attention, one being from Danielle Bregoli and one being from Abbie Parker. Regardless of your opinions or thoughts on the ex-patients I have listed, no one deserves to be treated this way, especially not children who were already traumatized beforehand. 

A lot of ex-patients actually claim to have no memory of their time being there because they were so dissociated and in an active trauma state during their ""treatment."" Police are aware of claims, but with little evidence, and most claims being made by ""untrustworthy sources,"" (the troubled youth,) there's not too much that can be done to this facility. 

Some claim this is cult behaviour, linking mind control and intimidation tactics. Some believe this is ritual abuse, having strict rules, set schedules, goals to follow in order to ""heal."" Some think this is just an uneducated facility, not attached to culty behaviour, but I would love to know what you guys think.

cults,lu3you,I want to pursue a different career but I am scared...," For the past year, I have dedicated my life to God. It has been a blessing. I still haven't found the right career for me and want to pursue a different career. I am scared because I will miss the church because they have always been there for me. It almost feels like I am stuck at the church because everyone around me goes to the church. The church scares you into leaving because they believe that life outside the church leads nowhere but darkness which is considered blacksliding. I want to leave and tell no one about it because they will try to stop me from leaving. I am extremely worried that if I go and pursue this career, it will only lead to failure. When I joined the church, there were a few red flags but I ignored them until I realized what the church is really about. I have been in other churches and they are not like this at all. I used to get rides from people at the church all the time so most of them know where I live. There is a house where some of the members live near me. Every time I leave the house, I am scared that I will bump into one of the church members. Something really weird that would happen is that I would get scolded for not attending church because of Covid. I would be forced to go to church or stay longer by the church members. I am kind of easily influenced so it might be my fault but I feel like the church should not be like this. I do not want to lose my faith or salvation in any way. What advice would you give me? I am not sure if this is the right community to post this."

God instituted the Day of Atonement in Leviticus 16:1-34:

 

1 The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD and died, 2 and the LORD said to Moses, ""Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat. 3 But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 4 He shall put on the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on. 5 And he shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. 6 ""Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. 7 Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 8 And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for Azazel. 9 And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the LORD and use it as a sin offering, 10 but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel. 11 ""Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself. 12 And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil 13 and put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is over the testimony, so that he does not die. 14 And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times. 15 ""Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. 16 Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins. And so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses. 17 No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel. 18 Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around. 19 And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel. 20 ""And when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat. 21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. 22 The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness. 23 ""Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and shall take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the Holy Place and shall leave them there. 24 And he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his garments and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people. 25 And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar. 26 And he who lets the goat go to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 27 And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. Their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned up with fire. 28 And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 29 ""And it shall be a statute to you forever that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict yourselves and shall do no work, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you. 30 For on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you. You shall be clean before the LORD from all your sins. 31 It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; it is a statute forever. 32 And the priest who is anointed and consecrated as priest in his father's place shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments. 33 He shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. 34 And this shall be a statute forever for you, that atonement may be made for the people of Israel once in the year because of all their sins."" And Aaron did as the LORD commanded Moses. (Leviticus 16:1-34 – English Standard Version 2011)

The Day of Atonement has a connection to Christ. This is because, as with the animals on the Day of Atonement, our sins laid on Jesus (see Isaiah 53:6) and he shed his blood to make atonement (Hebrews 9:11-12).

&amp;#x200B;

Jesus' sacrifice – unlike the animal sacrifices that were continually offered – was made once for all (Hebrews 10:1-18).

 

Romans 5:9 says, ""8 But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God."" (Romans 5:8-9 – English Standard Version 2011). And Hebrews 10:17-18 says, ""17 Then he adds, ""I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more."" 18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin."" (Hebrews 10:17-18 – English standard Version 2011).

 

After the death of Christ, the curtain of the temple that separated the holy place from the most holy place was torn in two, from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51). This gash of the curtain was an emblem, and indicated that the separation between Jews and Gentiles was now abolished, and that the privilege of the high priest was now available to all mankind: all since then could have access to the most holy place: ""Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus."" (Hebrews 10:19 – English Standard Version 2011).

cults,lp460b,"My case for Psychiatry as a cult for Big Pharma, the largest growing cult. - (Research Backed)","I was in the mental health system for 15 years and it does not live up to it's promises I left the entire thing in 2019. I'd describe Psychiatry as a cult based on quackery. I've tried every Psymed known to man it's not what it claims to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

**(Part 1 - The Quackery)**

* Psychmeds can create mental illnesses and false illusion of getting better.
* There is no such thing as a Biochemical Inbalance.
* Mental Illness don't exist and they are simply ""Problems with Living"" marketed for financial gain.

There is literally more evidence against psychiatry than there is for it. 

**(Part 2 - Cult)** 

Based on the evidence it's clear that Psychiatry has no basis. 

Thanks to most support groups for Mental Health and NAMI. (I think not, they are starting a cult)

Peer support groups are simply marketing tools.  Look at NAMI - [https://nami.org/Home](https://nami.org/Home)

I've been to many Peer Support Group for the last 2 year while in the mental health system. You weren't allowed to talk negative about psychmed, but you were allowed to say they didn't work for you. Often when going there, I they often would promote drugs and disqualify psychologist claiming being on drugs were near a cure. 

Before I left the entire Mental Health System and I still experience backlash  from people I don't still on meds. This was my experience has been who ever isn't on meds needs to be convinced to be on meds because ""They can be saved or feel better"" lol. I think not.  Notice, I said the  words  ""feel better"" I see more people on psychmeds that have created  the illusion that they are better when they are not. This same thing  happens  when people take other illegal drugs. People convince them to  take it  because they will feel better and everyone else is doing it so  it must  be okay right? Same thing happens in these support groups and  when you  see a Psychiatrist. They tell you it's okay the meds will help  you. What a crock of BS. If you are against taking meds they view you  as the  enemy or they tell you your mental ill and that you can't make  decisions  on your own. If you tell them your gonna stop your meds they  look at  you like ""Their really sick if he thinks that way""  we need to  save him  let's take him to the psychiatric hospital.

They tell you not to speak to others who are against psychmeds because they are sick themselves and need help and that you shouldn't  hanging out with them. They tell you if you hangout with people who are in recovery  you will recover together. I think this is a load of horseshit. I  haven't see anybody recover from anything while on meds. The meds cause suppression of your ability , emotions , and create a false illusion  and perception that your getting better.

cults,lovzkp,Very unpopular opinion.,"Ok so first of all I am not a Nazi sympathizer. I am far from it. Yet here's my very unpopular opinion. Around the world Hitler is known as the most evil person in the world correct? I believe that should be re-evaluated not because he doesn't deserve to be on the list but because when he was committing mass murder he was killing people that everyone knew he hated. No one ever calls Jim Jones or any of these other cult leaders the most evil person in the world even though these people are responsible for the death of the ones they supposedly loved. Maybe I'm wrong but I think that if you kill people that you supposedly love then that makes you more evil than killing people that everyone knows you hate.

With that being said, I hope all of them from Jim Jones to David koresh to Hitler to the Cracker Jack that was running Heaven's Gate and every other person that has ever been the cause of mass murder is suffering a fate worse than death.

cults,loa9vf,Still healing from Remnant Fellowship Church cult years later,"Honestly this is the first place on the Internet that I have found a community of people who actually might understand the things I have gone through as a former member of a cult church and it’s comforting to know that there are others out there. I wanted to share my story and how I have healed and continue to heal from my traumatic experiences (apologies for the long post). 

Background: my parents became heavily involved in the Weigh Down ministries when I was 10. Weigh Down is a program that preaches about how to lose weight in a way that will keep off the pounds forever. This way involves trading a focus on food for a focus on (supposedly) God. What it actually boils down to is a severe caloric deficit, starving yourself, and not eating healthy foods or maintaining a good lifestyle. The founder of Weigh Down, Gwen Shamblin, ended up starting her own church Remnant Fellowship in which the Weigh Down classes play a big part. You are essentially booted out of the church or, at the very least, asked to sit on the sidelines for a while if you are overweight or cannot lose your weight in a timely manner. This is an extremely condensed version of years of unhealthy eating habits that I have had to undo and still continue to work to get rid of. 

My parents joined Remnant Fellowship church when I was 11. This church is based in Brentwood, Tennessee, and holds webcasts on the internet for people like my family who live in a different state. However, we were required to attend events around 4 times a year in person. I didn’t really see what was wrong with the church until I was 14 and starting to want to become my own person and look towards my future. I started to notice sickening little details, like if you look any different than the rest of the herd (i.e. are not beautiful by society standards) you are not very popular or part of the “in” crowd. If you come from a wealthy family, major bonus points! You’ve won a ticket to be Gwen Shamblin’s absolute BFF for life, or, at least until your money runs out. As I grew up in the church, every single little thing I did was monitored. Internet, texts, who I talked to in person, alone time in my room (spoiler: I wasn’t allowed any alone time). I once got reprimanded for talking to a boy (seriously, like making one comment) during a sermon at an event at the church in TN and my parents were instructed to punish me for this action. By the time I was in high school, I had turned into a cunning and lying teenager in order to have any semblance of a normal life. I was not allowed to hang out with anyone who was not a church member (unless I hid it). I was not allowed to listen to music that was not from the church. I was not allowed to have a boyfriend (or girlfriend; you’re immediately condemned to hell if you’re part of the LGBTQ+ community). It all reached a boiling point when my parents shipped me off to TN when I was 17. They made me stay at a leader of the church’s house. This leader tried to force me into dating multiple boys (I say boys because their maturity level was zero) in order to find a suitable future husband. I tried to worm my way out of each situation into when I was forced, and each situation became more and more anxiety-inducing for me. You are not allowed to have sex before marriage; due to this, the single men in the church are basically frothing at the mouth to get married and finally have sex. Young marriages (18 years old) occur all the time because of this. 

****TRIGGER WARNING****
I finally had enough when a guy who the leader was trying to force me to go out with sent me unsolicited pictures of his penis and asked for photos of my boobs in return. I had just turned 18 and I demanded to my parents that I return back to my home state. I informed them that I would not be forced into a bad marriage to someone who I did not want, I would not be forced to go to a college I did not desire to attend, and I would NOT be throwing my life away for a cult. They did not believe me about the photos (I had deleted them in an anxiety-induced panic). My parents ended up coming to TN themselves to try to force me to stay; my mom told me I was possessed by Satan and that’s why I wouldn’t listen to them. The church leadership basically had to legally tell them to take me home since I was 18 and they couldn’t make me stay. We ended up going home. Fast forward 2 years: my parents and I were on slightly better terms and I was living at home and attending college. In the middle of all this, I met my future husband and was harboring a secret boyfriend from them. I was unbelievably happy because I had finally found a small piece of normalcy and a hint of a silver lining to my life that I had hated so much before. 

My parents ended up finding out about the secret boyfriend and the church told them to punish me accordingly: take me out of school and ensure that I wouldn’t and couldn’t leave the house for months. I screamed at my parents and had a panic attack while telling them that this could not happen. My dad physically attacked me and I ended up calling my boyfriend who called the cops. The cops showed up and informed my parents that they could not keep me at home or take me out of college because I was 20 years old. My parents denied all involvement and said that I attacked my own father (I am livid about this to this day). The cops told me it was basically their word against mine so I did not pursue any legal action. I ended up leaving and moving out and marrying my boyfriend within a week. On the way out, my dad’s last words to me were that I would NEVER succeed in life and I would be cursed by God in every way. 

This year marks 8 years that I left my parents’ house and Remnant Fellowship church. I now own my own house, I have several college degrees, a great job, amazing friends, and a family who I adore. I am still healing from the years of abuse (way too much to type out) and the years of fearing that something horrible would happen to me if I left the church. Every year a small piece of myself that I lost in my childhood mends itself and I feel a little lighter. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."
cults,lo814e,There's always a supereror.,"So tonight it has come to my conclusion (yes I might be drunk and yes I think my words are words of wisdom at this very point of time)..

But the difference of cult beliefs in comparison to religion are there's always a leader who is in human form and can vocally speak to their followers. 

I believe in self awareness and higher self so no way in hell am I in any beleif of a single God apart from thy self (yeah no I really do hate religion)

If God were a legit speaking breathing eating shitting human who could voice his shit then yes Armageddon would've been over and done with by now.

Could you imagine the almighty controlling the world? Think about that for a second. 

Now look at every cult in all of history of mankind. There was always a leader. A manipulative brainwashing asshole preaching bullshit saying they're the chosen one to speak for whatever God. Or they can take you to the height of your superior being by taking their orders with contributing a fucn load of money.

Yes religions do this, some worse then others. But there's never a single communicator as far as I know.

Again I'm wasted.

cults,lnq3ah,Is my former church a cult or just spiritually abusive?,"The thing that's prompting me to write this post is googling the church I grew up in and finding many, many 5-star Google reviews--from longtime (think 20, 30 years) members of the church. I can't find anything on the internet, so I hope someone--maybe even a current or former member--can find this post and relate. I want to hear your perspectives--is my former church a cult--or ""just"" spiritually abusive? What are the characteristics that distinguish a ""cult"" from a spiritually abusive religious organization? This is also a rant.

I grew up in Hope Church (formerly Hope Community Church) in Fort Worth, Texas, until I moved away for college. The church, affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, was founded in 1978 and has prided itself on its ""innovative"" way of doing church. It has its own ""Global Network""--almost its own denomination with its own teachings. I'm going to list characteristics of this church in bullet point format-- otherwise this post could be very long. I can elaborate. Some of these points aren't markers of a ""cult"" per se, but they might provide a better feel for the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

* Reverence of the senior/founding pastor. The church's identity is very much bound up with his role as its founder
* Nepotism in church leadership
* Leadership requiring members to sign ""covenants"" of loyalty--yearly and for other smaller commitments, like bible studies
* Forced positivity
* Ignoring member feedback, discouraging negative feedback; no open system for feedback
* Frequently warning members against ""gossip,"" paranoia about rumors
* Excessive concern about public image
* Quietly encouraging men to hide their ""sexual sin"" from their wives(!!!) because women can't handle it emotionally
* \^ doing the above while encouraging members to ""live an open and honest life."" Oh, the hypocrisy...
* Shaming members for participating in outside Christian groups and bible studies
* Shaming parents and youth for participating in extracurricular activities
* Shaming parents for sending kids to public school (the last straw for my mother: one Sunday she observed my brother, a middle schooler attending public school, sitting in the front row of the sanctuary with his friends. In his sermon, the pastor touched on the dangers of public school--its corrupting influence--and why parents should be ashamed of themselves for sending kids there)
* Just a whole lot of shame. At one point, a young man who'd gotten his gf pregnant was forced to apologize in front of the entire congregation. A youth pastor often shamed his own sons, using them as examples.
* Forcing people to apologize to one another for minor wrongs
* Dogmatic insistence on new-earth creationism
* Discouraging youth from going to college
* Skepticism and hostility toward academics and scientists
* Belief that our church is superior to all the other churches
* Maaaajor persecution complex, ""us vs. them"" mentality
* Lots of intermarriage (I don't know if ""intermarriage"" is the right word, but most youth who get married get married to other members)"

I then asked her if the souls in fourth dimensional hell feel like they are stuck.  She answered, ""No"".  I then asked if they enjoy being in hell.  She answered, ""No"".  I then moved on to my next question.  I asked her if in my core, that I am a spark of divine, and am an aspect of the purist highest energy.  She answered, ""Yes in a sense"".  I then asked Mary if my soul has a mind of its own, different than my body's mind.  She answered, ""Yes"".  I then asked Mary if I incarnated with Divine intelligence and divine intent, coming to Earth with a life plan and higher guidance.  She answered, ""No"".  I then asked Mary about a question I had asked before.  It was if I have a soul archetype.  Previously she had answered, ""This is not a phrase I know how to translate to you"".  So now I asked her if she can say something about the soul archetype to me.  She answered, ""No"".  Then she wrote, ""What I know will not lm"".  I asked her for the word after ""Not"" because ""Lm"" didn't make sense..  She wrote, ""translate to anything you can fathom"".  So, what she wrote was, ""What I know will not translate to anything you can fathom"".

cults,lkcuum,"Actors, Beware: You May Be in a Cult","Words Between Coasts

""When most people think about cults, they often assume that they are too intelligent or self-aware to get sucked in. 

However, many actors in L.A. have been misled into taking acting classes that exhibit cult-like practices… And they never even realize it. 

When I watched the documentaries The Vow and Seduced, both about the cult NXIVM, I couldn’t help but flash back to several different acting classes I had taken in my 15+ years of being an actor in L.A. The coercion and fear tactics that NXIVM utilized were strikingly similar to the tactics used in these acting classes. The teachers are treated like gods and worshipped; the students are abused and berated, consistently screamed at and torn down; people are told what to do and how to live their lives, because the teacher is right and you are taught that everybody else in your life is trying to do you harm; and most actors end up going broke paying for these overpriced classes. 

Acting classes exploit these cult practices much more than the students realize. 

I was especially reminded of one acting school in particular. 

Luckily, I had an upper hand in this situation because I was previously warned of the cult-like tendencies of the classes at this school. I went in armed with knowledge, only agreeing to start taking classes because I heard it was a good education. Even with this prior knowledge, there were still times when it was difficult for me not to fall prey to the cult mentality. 

It was my first day. The class started at 7pm. I happily walked in at about 6:55, excited to start. One of the girls in the class who I later learned to be the stage manager walked up to me and accusingly demanded, “where have you been?” 

“Oh… I was just talking to someone outside.” 

She gave me an incredibly disapproving look. 

“Well, you’re late, and I’m gonna have to mark that down.” 

“But… I thought class started at seven.” 

She looked at me like an exasperated parent looks at their disobedient child. 

“You have to be here ten minutes early.” 

“I didn’t know that.” 

“Ok. Just go sit down.” 

I sat down, and barely a few minutes later the student in the sound booth started blasting music so loudly that I felt my chair vibrating. Everyone sprang to their feet. The stage manager proudly announced the teacher. He sauntered into the room like some big-shot celebrity with all of the students cheering, clapping, and stomping their feet. He stood at his chair and drank in the applause, the food for his ego, for a few more moments before nonchalantly waving his hand, signaling for the music to stop and the students to sit down. 

And that was how every class started. It intrinsically gave all of the teachers this deep-seated power. The students worshipped the teachers. 

Every day they called roll so that they could keep tabs on us. People who didn’t show up or were late were reprimanded, as if we weren’t all adults capable of making our own decisions. The only acceptable excuses for being late or not coming to class were extreme illness, a death in the family, or industry work. People sometimes would show up to class sick because they weren’t sick enough for the excuse to be valid. The teachers enforced this because they wanted to impress upon us the importance of showing up to an acting job under any condition. They said that if it wasn’t serious enough to decline a job, then it wasn’t serious enough to miss class. This led to unhealthy behaviors, both mentally and physically. People experienced extreme guilt and pushed themselves so hard that many of them experienced breakdowns. 

The teachers would dig so deeply into their students’ minds by procuring valuable information on their personal lives. 

Acting is a tricky thing because it is inherently very personal, so it’s difficult to be in a class without revealing certain intimate information. It is often helpful for a teacher to help understand your psyche and approach to the characters; it can even sometimes be cathartic for the actor. However, these teachers would collect this information to use against their students. The teachers would mention certain friends or family members and encourage the students to cut ties. “They’re invalidating to you and your career. Stop speaking to them. Refrain from calling them. Don’t go to their house for the holidays. They’re not on your side. They don’t want what’s best for you.” I saw many people in my two years at this school estrange themselves from parents, siblings, childhood friends…. It was sad. 

The teachers would use the students’ insecurities to manipulate them into doing unhealthy things like needlessly losing weight. 

The teachers would mention to the actors that they probably didn’t have the stamina to be on set, or that they weren’t getting jobs or auditions because of their size, or that they’d be attractive if they just got thinner. They would convince perfectly healthy people to start a diet and add further insecurities to many already-vulnerable actors. It was abusive. 

The abuse didn’t stop there. 

Many acting teachers in L.A. are known for screaming at their students, and the teachers at this school were no exception. This often created an effect similar to Stockholm syndrome. A student would be berated into a breakdown, and then start clinging to the teacher for praise. They became completely dependent on the teacher for any ounce of self-worth. Students would beat themselves up for performances the teacher didn’t like, and sob out of relief for performances the teacher praised.""

""It was still two hours before dawn when Russian state security officers smashed their way into Yury and Ekaterina Chernyshev’s apartment in Moscow. The intruders, wearing black balaclavas and carrying automatic weapons, knocked Yury, 57, to the ground, and slammed his wife up against a wall as their teenage daughter looked on in horror. 

The Chernyshevs are not terrorists, drug dealers or crime gang bosses. They were targeted because they are Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Christian group best known for its door-to-door proselytising. In 2017 the Russian Supreme Court outlawed Jehovah’s Witnesses as “extremists”, a ruling that placed the apolitical and pacifist Christian organisation on a par with Isis and neo-Nazi movements. 

The ruling came after the justice ministry stated that Russia’s 175,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses were a threat to “public order and public security” and government officials accused them of preaching the “exclusivity and supremacy” of their beliefs. 

As the Kremlin cracks down on the opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his allies it is also waging a brutal campaign against those who fail to follow the official line on religion, which favours the powerful Russian Orthodox Church. 

Since the ruling 12 Jehovah’s Witnesses have been given prison terms. The latest verdict came on Wednesday when a court in the southern Krasnodar region jailed a 63-year-old man for 7½ years. His crime? He had taken part in online Bible study discussions with fellow believers.""

cults,ljmdly,"I survived Comunità Cenacolo, barely","Comunità Cenacolo is an Italian Catholic organization for addicts with houses all over the world. It's also very much cult-like.

I've spent 9 months in a house in France and I left after seeing some acts of Jesus-legitimized violence that scared the hell out of me.

I now have clinical post-traumatic stress and I'm having nightmares every night about my experience. I'm looking for support and for people who had similar experiences. I wanna know if I'm alone or not. 

It's hard to describe the community.

You go there as a last resort. Not of your own accord of course. The community instructs your family to give you the choice between going to the Cenacolo or cutting all ties with you. They are a very well trained organization and have plenty of ""resurrection"" examples of addicts to show to convince parents this is the only way out for their addict children.

There you are forced to pray - 3 rosaries a day, 2 masses a week, and adorations, sometimes in the middle of the night. On average there are about 160 ""Ave Maria""s recited each day.

You work 8-10 hours a day, 6 days a week. Work is usually boring and pointless, like sawing wood or moving stacks of stones around. It can be humiliating, like cleaning the toilets on your knees with your bare hands.

There are countless rules to abide by and everybody yells at you if you don't follow them. No hands in your pockets, no sitting during the 8 hours of work, no singing... 

When you enter the community they take your phone, ID documents, money, keys, even the piece of paper where you may have written down your friends' addresses just in case.

There's no television, no phone, no newspapers, no contact with the outside world. When you enter you are not even allowed to speak with guys that have not been here long enough. You can send/receive letters after some time. In some houses they read the letters before deciding to mail them / give them to you.

To some extent this lifestyle works, so that after a few months when your family is allowed to visit they see you in good physical health and with a clear mind. And when you try to tell them it's hell they tell you you're exaggerating and go away happy.

There are no doctors no medications and no psychologists. The only therapy is God. Got an hernia? Work hard and pray on it.

I suffer from depression and I have spent 8 months contemplating suicide every fucking day.

They justify your pain, be it physical or mental, by saying that you have sinned in your life before and must pay the price. They tell you that suffering is good because it is a sacrifice you offer for Jesus, like he for us when he was crucified.

When you want to leave they use every possible way to guilt or threat you into staying.

What frightened me most is that after a while I began adhering to some of the insane ideas. Mind control does work. I was forgetting ""my old self"" but also myself as a whole. I saw other people change and it scared me. They lost their critical thinking, their personality.

I ended up deciding to exit the community whatever the cost when a friend of mine was beaten up for 3 hours then put in isolation for 10 days  by the responsible of the community and an old community guy  - because he had managed to find alcohol and got drunk. The one hitting him kept saying with every blow: ""you see, it's the good that's winning."". And our in-house priest and spiritual leader was fine with it.

The community is boasting huge successes but there are no statistics and no studies. It does work for some people, that is undeniable.

But how many leave in pieces, alone, and kill themselves or fall back to drugs even harder? We hear many such stories, but again nobody has any statistics.

I'd very much like to shed some light on the community because the pain some of us go through there hurts me deeply. I do not believe in God, but I don't think God would have wanted the community. God left us free will, community took it."

https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/problems-with-leader-in-me/

Most interesting is Donnie Wilkerson’s (a commenter on the article) take:

“The almost sole benefactor to the “round tripping” I Am a Leader Foundation, Andrew Cherng, is also a big fan of Landmark. Anyone who doubts the Covey cult connection would do well to research this scary group. These folks and their minions spurn free inquiry and as such pose a clear and present danger to liberty and freedom. It’s time for a national exposé of Landmark and Leader in Me! Round-tripping refers to the practice in charitable organizations where contributions (tax deductible!) come full circle to help just an intended select recipient. The IAALF receives about 4 million dollars a year from Panda Express (Cherng’s company). It then issues “grants” (around 100 per year at usually about 40 grand each) to gullible schools who must agree to pay Covey another $7,500 – $8,000 per year for five years from its own coffers. Additionally the school must agree to host annual events to help sell other investigator schools on the program (think pyramid marketing). Interestingly the schools never see the “grant money”, it’s paid directly to FranklinCovey! In effect they get a product that’s worth arguably nothing for the “‘bargain” price of $40,000 rather than its grossly inflated sticker price of some 80 grand . . .the kicker, Panda ostensibly gets a 4 million dollar write- off while Covey adds 4 million (plus the other 4 million from the schools) to its Education Practice Division revenue. Take a look at FranklinCovey stock prices (stock symbol FC on the NYSE) and you will find that, before the advent of TLIM, shares were trading at pennies each (0.72 in April 2003) with the outlook for the company bleak. When this exploitive program came along Covey stock peaked at near 23 dollars (22.50 in June 2014). The stock is most recently trading in the high teens amid less than lackluster performance by the company’s other divisions. Leader in Me has no place in our public schools!”"
cults,lihhux,Healing from Narccisstic abuse," 

Hey everyone. Im looking for some tips on how I can heal from narcissistic abuse. I was in a cult for about 2 -4 months. (Honestly when I was with them I had no idea wtf was going on, I felt completely confused and insane, I have no idea how much time actually went by. I initially thought it was only 2 weeks but my family members say it was a lot longer than that.) And the abuse was ongoing afterwords, possibly to this day but hard to discern as there was/is serious brainwashing and programming being done. This is an online cult. 

Currently working on thought reform and PTSD with a therapist.

However, I have this seething hatred towards these people as they quite frankly fucked me up badly, causing psychosis as well as problems with my friends and family members and co workers. I didn't consciously join a cult. And they say the cult mindset is a ""guru disciple"" mindset. I was led to them through a series of spiritual events in which they were the only people who had the answer. It wasn't the answer it was just that this cult leader was actually doing all this stuff to me. Dealing with entities at night ritual abuse, etc.

I understand I have to forgive them. But do I have compassion for them? Or what's the best perspective.

How can I better perceive this situation or frame it in my mind. I understand that these people are narcissistic sociopaths that lack empathy. I'm studying psychopathy so I can at least understand the nature of this abuse.

From what I've been able to come up with these people must be in a lot of pain, and have a lot of hatred towards others and just feel as if they are justified in doing this to people. And I should empathize and have compassion for this. As I am not a sociopath or psychopath, I just have such a hard time resonating with them and a very hard time understanding why they would do this. Especially abuse of this nature where the karma that comes back to them is extremely heavy. (Abusing Kundalini for attack and messing with peoples minds) Im assuming they do it for money although it can't be that much money... or just get off controlling other people like this (Megalomaniacs)

Does anyone have any insights into this situation? These people are very cruel and have consistently wanted me to kill myself and to seem schizophrenic.

While i was with them I had a significant psychic opening. I am working with a spiritual coach, they suggest medication to help me shut down my third eye until some of these psychological and emotional issues calm down.

I have always disliked the idea of using medication and she says she never really suggest people to use pharmaceuticals but for my case she thinks they'll actually help a lot. So I'm currently started on an anti psychotic- as well as gabapentin for the anxiety and ptsd.

Thanks so much for reading. I hope that there may be someone that can offer some advice for me. Thanks so much."

and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man. (Hebrews 8:2 – New International Version 1984).

11 When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. 12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. (Hebrews 9:11-12 – New International Version 1984).

For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. (Hebrews 9:24 – New International Version 1984).

After this I looked and in heaven the temple, that is, the tabernacle of the Testimony, was opened. (Revelation 15:5 – New International Version 1984).

Revelation 15:5 makes it clear that the tabernacle is not heaven, but a thing that is in heaven. Then it is sure that Hebrews 9:24 does not imply that heaven is the true sanctuary, since the sanctuary, also called ""Most Holy Place"" etc., is part of the tabernacle, and it is the innermost part of it.
Hebrews 9:24 means that Christ, having entered heaven, as a consequence entered the sanctuary which is in heaven and which is not man-made because it is a thing made in heaven (i.e. not part of this creation (Hebrews 9:11)); in opposition to not having entered a man-made sanctuary (i.e. of part of this creation).
Hebrews 8:2, saying that the true tabernacle has been set up by the Lord, not by man, cannot be used as confirmation that the true tabernacle is heaven, because you might say that God has set up heaven. Nor can Hebrews 9:11 be used as confirmation that the true tabernacle is heaven. The reason is because saying that this tabernacle is not part of this creation, does not necessarily imply that it is not heaven but that it is only one thing that is part of the other creation, that is, heaven. These two passages confirm that the tabernacle is not heaven, but only one thing that is part of it, if you take into account some other verse, such as Revelation 15:5, which gives the confirmation.

Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. (Hebrews 4:14 – New International Version 1984).

Moreover, Hebrews 4:14, saying that Jesus has gone through the heavens, does not give the conclusion that the true tabernacle is heaven.

Therefore, the true tabernacle of which Hebrews 8:2 speaks is the tabernacle that is in heaven. As Hebrews 9:11 says, the tabernacle in heaven is greater and more perfect than the earthly tabernacle. It is a material tabernacle like the earthly tabernacle, and is called ""true"" because the earthly tabernacle was only a copy of the tabernacle in heaven, as was also its innermost part, the sanctuary (Hebrews 9:24)."

cults,lhg1oe,"Bentinho Massaro, a cult leader on the rise","Hey all, 

I live in Tucson, AZ. Sedona is a stone's throw away from Tucson, and as many of you may already be aware, Sedona is a wort for brewing cults. Gabriel of Sedona/Urantia has been in the cult biz for a long time in Sedona, and he has operations all over southern Arizona. Weirdly, not many are even aware of him, let alone are aware of all the weird shit he has his hands in our community. In Tucson, he has his own radio station you can tune in on that plays his music exclusively (his followers of course are only allowed to listen to his music), he has a farm, ""Avalon Organic Gardens"", which for a short while was used to supply produce to his uber-hip vegan restaurant, ""Food for the Ascension"". He still owns another business in town ""Sea of Glass"". 

Bentinho Massaro is another, new cult-leader in Sedona. And man, this guy is scary...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVROUxwWkeA&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVROUxwWkeA&amp;t=1s)

...yea, that guy is DEFINITELY going to shoot somebody. 

Traveling across the globe from the Netherlands to the deserts of Arizona, he is a cult-leader for the tech generation; he utilizes social media, youtube, and Instagram to advertise his ""teachings"".  His followers ""oo"" and ""ahh"" because he swears and is always smoking a cigar while wearing some pretty snazzy clothing as if to make the appeal to woo-woo quacks that ""you can be enlightened and also worldly, have an Instagram and take selfies, drive a nice car, smoke, drink..."" so on and so forth. Oh yes, and he's apparently not a regular human, but an enlightened alien who has already begun making grandiose claims of godhood. 

The charlatanry is so glaring, it's a parody of itself. Check out this sweet promo-vid for a  spiritual retreat to the Netherlands! (Oh yea, it's expensive.)

Yup, never heard that new-age bullshit before...this guy is ON to something. 

I have an acquaintance who defected from Massaro's cult and described it as nothing less thn that. It's hard to say how dangerous he actually is in terms of getting people to drink the cool-aid, but I am of the belief that all cults are inherently dangerous and immoral. Also, he has already come out saying he has been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (big surprise), 

A few years back, Bentinho picked up some attention from an article posted by the Guardian, describing the events of one of his followers having a mental breakdown and committing suicide. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/strange-hypnotic-world-millennial-guru-bentinho-massaro-youtube](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/strange-hypnotic-world-millennial-guru-bentinho-massaro-youtube) 

He's been on watch since then, but not much is really known about the inside activities of this cult, given its insularity. 

He's shifted his attention ""Mirror Talks "" during Covid, hours-long ramblings that are supposed to ""reveal"" his teachings so that they are ""accessible"" to people on the lower spiritual hierarchy.

You can even pick up on the subtle manipulations and power-plays he's using on these two women. Cory Katuna is obviously very in love with him. His demeanor towards her in these videos is rather cold, even belittling, while the other girl is just pure fucking brilliance and sunshine!

It's pretty sad...Cory Katuna managed his social media accounts while he was on ""sabbatical"" for six months. It's pretty clear every part of her life is controlled by this man. She is in the process of being withdrawn and isolated from her non-cult dwelling friends and family.

""This is a bit radical but it’s also been a long time coming: I’m breaking up with my social life.

The truth is that I don’t care about what happened or who said what or even intelligent conversations or insightful opinions or fun social activities or details about how people’s lives are going or what you know and want and like and think.

What I care about is self discovery on the deepest level. I care about becoming my true self and causing the people around me to become themselves too. I care about people knowing themselves and living their lives in alignment with their truth. That’s it.

The Letter which Pastor Ed sent to Becky before splitting from the rest of Berkland. To save face and lessen the effects of the split, all Berkland churches were then asked to change their names in order to make it seem like a unified decision for each church to become “independent.” 

August 22, 2005

Dear Becky JDSN:

It grieves me to write this, but after much anguished prayer, I decided that to do this in writing would be the best.

In Daegu, I challenged you on what I believe to be evidence of how much you have changed for the worse over the years, and your unhealthy leadership. The issues I addressed in Daegu has to do with your dangerous self-understanding; lack of commitment to truth telling; your cynicism toward the Word, and ministry; your excessive, nearly-addictive playing of Bbong (뻥) see note, personally, and with your staff and at the pastors meetings, and what this reveals about your leadership; your self-understanding as a person of special status (e.g. prophetess, apostle, etc); your secularized lifestyle; your family idolatry, and nepotism; the queen-like, high-maintenance person you have become; and your defining many of these negative changes as the new spirituality which all BBCs should follow.

The main issue is the last one. If I am free to criticize you, and disassociate myself with what you are doing, and refuse to follow, then it's less of a problem. If you were honest that these are negative changes in you, and you appropriately downgrade your self-understanding, and your role in BBC, then, again, it would not be a problem. But you want all of us to justify all you do, all the ways in which you have changed; whatever you do must be baptized in spiritualized rhetoric. You expect all of us to not only swallow the absurd justifications, but also impose the same on our sheep. It is too much ""moo-li."" (무리) excessive, unreasonable I can no longer do the former, and refuse—as I should—to do the latter. In other words, my problem is not with just your character problems. I do not demand perfection from you as my leader. I can accept you with all your faults. But I cannot deny your faults, or rationalize or spiritualize them for you. This is unhealthy for me, for you, and for our church.

Somewhere along the line, I stopped trying to convince myself with rationalizations for your behavior. I began to call (inwardly, to myself) your behavior and character whatever it would be called by neutral objective observers: self-fascinated; selfish; hot-tempered and verbally abusive; princess-like; unable to take criticism; never repenting for anything; bragging; elitist; secular; self contradictory (as when you say that you are the busiest woman immediately after having played Bbong for days); chaotic; dishonest; manipulative; political. But the problem is that no one can ever call it what it is when it comes to you. With anyone else, we would be roundly critical; with you, we have to beautify it, spiritualize it. This causes people's inner faculties to be broken. No pastor should demand this of his flock.

Again, at the risk of being redundant, the main problem is your insistence on your nearly-inerrant role as a Pope-like figure. Since you can do no wrong, when you DO (and you do, indeed!), we must justify it. Often, you provide your own rationalizations, and we must accept them (and suffer inner damage), and pass them on to others, and crush any who don't accept it. This is morally wrong. Anyone else who do what you do, say what you say, and have the kind of character flaws you have will be rejected as a spiritual leader. Yet, in the strange and warped BBC pastoral world, the reverse must happen. You become exempt from all normal criteria of evaluating persons; you become above the law. Up becomes down, right becomes left, wrong becomes right.

The irony of our situation is that a few years ago, the Korean dept. leaders were severely rebuked for not challenging P. Andy Lee, since even before the adultery was discovered there was so much that was troubling about his leadership in the final 2 years or so.

I had been praying for some time now for God to do something by the 25th anniversary. I had no intention of initiating anything in our Boston meetings or in Daegu. But I resolved to be honest. I told one of the other pastors in an email: ""I just want to survive the Daegu meeting."" But you began by calling Chris ""satan."" I had to step in and tell you that most of my reservations about your leadership and character have nothing to do with what Chris told me, but based on things I directly observed. And so it all came out.

I meant everything I said in Daegu. I know it must have been traumatizing for you to hear all of it like that, but I had hoped that you would recognize the truth in what I was saying.

I went to Irvine with this hope. The first night, you spoke for about 7 hours straight. Your entire speech, containing many details revealed for the first time, basically was ""My Life with Pastor Paul."" It started with your honeymoon, how awful it was, how cheap he was to get second-rate places, ""inns,"" rather than ""hotels."" You went on and on about how frustrating it is to daily deal with such a person as P. Paul, and that Chris, and me, two people with happy marriages would not understand. You also went on to attack Kelly as a child raised by a widow, that most families would not have welcomed such a person as a daughter-in-law. You wondered if we would be in this place if I had married someone else. So odd that you should try to interpret the serious issues I brought up by wondering if the issues would not have been brought up if I had married a more frustrating spouse. And you said things similar toward Chris, mentioning some unsavory thing about his father. (You like the word ""noble."" I think this was quite ignoble of you.) You went on and on about how the rich do not understand the poor, and how, similarly, the happily-wed do not understand those with bad marriages. Oddly, you seemed to be saying that to be unhappily married qualifies people for greater spiritual leadership. You punctuated your speech with a refrain, repeated throughout your monologue: ""Could you not have a bit more mercy on me?"" But this was said in a tone of bitter and mocking sarcasm.

I felt so disappointed by such a display of unwarranted self-pity. First it was not relevant, since my concerns had to do with your very real, official, public, and dominant role throughout BBC as something like our Pope; Second, it was a display of the kind of self-pity quite at odds with our message and values. At no point during our Irvine meeting did you ever acknowledge any wrongdoing, or any truth in anything Chris and I said in Daegu. You continued to defend and justify, and occasionally, sarcastically admitted some small character flaw of yours here and there—""yes, I have a bad temper, but it's because I deal with people's sin.""

I proposed at the end of our meeting that we talk one on one, since these large group meetings are not all that fruitful. You rejected this, saying that it will most likely result in mutual hurts. Then Soomi came up on Monday to talk to Kelly. It was a very frustrating conversation. She evaded direct questions regarding what she thought of specific things you did, which we thought were very very clear examples of wrong. She was lawyer-like in her ability to evade, saying, for example, that all the movie watching, Bbong playing was just a ""phase"" we are going through, which would soon end, but she refused to say if it was a negative phase or a positive phase. She brought word from you that you are now ready to talk with me, because many things became organized (""jung-li"") (정리) arrange in order in your mind during your flight back to Boston.

Again, with some hope, I called. After our telephone conversation later that night, I was once again very disappointed.

You began by saying that on your plane ride back from Irvine, you kept thinking about one thing I said: ""you disapprove of my ministry."" You said that the word disapprove kept coming back, and that through this one word, you were able to enter into my mind/heart, and understand me and Kelly. You said that we must feel so very ""ug-ool-hae,"" (억울해) frustration owing to injustice and that I am right to feel this way. You said that we did ""nothing wrong,"" that all we did was work hard at our ministry, and that now, we are being criticized for some minute differences. You said that of all the pastors, Kelly and I are the ones you are the most thankful toward. (It was disorienting to hear such words of flattery after all the terrible expressions you used to criticize Kelly in Daegu, and then again in Irvine, just a few days prior.) You said that none of the other pastors know what is actually going on because you consulted me exclusively on many sensitive incidents, and I was the one who handled them with you.

I am sorry to say, but JDSN, I felt that much of the conversation was inauthentic on your part. You were speaking words designed for impact—to melt my heart—without a strong commitment to truth. This became clear when you said that on your plane ride back, you had to ask yourself the question: ""Do I indeed (""Gwa-yun"") (과연) do indeed disapprove of Eddie's ministry?"" But the fact is you have been disapproving of me, and Berkeley ministry openly to many others (never directly to me!), including Boston campus staff, for many years now. So you were lying to me when you said that you had to ask yourself this question--unless you are genuinely out of touch with yourself, and all the things you have done for years to make me feel ""ug-ool-hae.""

You said that your own answer to this question was that you might have slightly disapproved of my ministry with respect to the course 101 vs. John 1-1 issue (John 1-1: Becky's own introduction to Christianity course based on UBF material), a very recent development. The fact is, however, your disapproval of me and my ministry has been a long-standing practice. And as I told you during our conversation, I have gotten used to it. I think it is your right as my leader to do this. Of course, it violates covenant faithfulness toward me to do this before the younger ones, behind my back, even to those currently under me, and at the mission field, but this kind of disregard for proper boundaries has been characteristic of you in all sorts of ways. It really drove P. Andy Lee crazy, as I recall, when you undermined the legitimacy of all that he was doing, criticizing him and his ministry to many people under him, and to us (YB, me, and the rest of the English dept. staff.)

You then went on to brutally criticize Andy with harsh words. You said that when Andy called to ask you about the Irvine meeting, you yelled at him, saying, ""What do you know? etc"" and refused to talk to him. (I actually doubt that this is exactly how it went.) Again, this is something you have done many times. Criticize Andy, or YB, or Peter in front of me, with harsh words--especially Andy. You usually couple this with statements that flatter me. This is one of the reasons that I once told you that you are the ""most divisive person at BBC."" It insults me that your view of me is such that you think it would delight me to hear you harshly criticize Andy for no apparent reason.

Finally, you told me in a soft, confiding tone, that there is something you had not shared with anyone. You went on to say that you are very worried about Chris, that you think he is emotionally unstable, that this is due to the fact that SV ministry has been hard, with Cha Joona dying, divorces, etc. (Chris said in response to this that being at SV has been much much better than being in Boston. I think he said ""thousand times."") Your solution was to have him leave for Th.M at somewhere like Southwestern. He can leave immediately, before the fall semester. But, you said, this means that I have to take on SV ministry. I could not believe what you were saying to me. You were actually offering me greater territory! You made sure that I understood what you were offering me by adding that Chris would not return to SV, but to Pasadena, to begin a new ministry at Cal Tech, since he did well at MIT, and he is an engineer.

All of this was insulting to me, that you would think that by flattering me, and by offering me greater territory--all of SV--that I would be happy and appeased. I am sure you would protest your innocence, but I just cannot interpret it in any other way. And I realized that you just don't get it. I felt hopeless. It's as if a son told his dad, ""Dad, please stop drinking, because when you come home drunk, you are violent and you frequently beat mom."" And the dad's thinking process is: humm… why is he saying this? What does he want? And he responds to his son by saying: ""Hey, do you want me to buy you a new car?""

The sad conclusion I reached after the Irvine meeting was confirmed by this phone conversation. I lost all hope of genuine dialogue. After I refused your offer of SV, I sat there bewildered, disappointed once again, but much more resolved and clear as to what I need to do.

Our church has become sick. The sickness of your character has infected our entire BBC organism with a deep sickness. You have diminished many who were loyal to you, who trusted you, who gave you so much faithfulness. You have been unfaithful to your own messages; you have betrayed many people; you have corrupted them; you have weakened their sense of judgment; you turned all of them into ""hwa-toe-koon-dul"" (화토꾼들) ""pro"" hwa-toe players, a disparaging term as it is a disreputable occupation (as most Korean people will, in all fairness, call all of us); you drink up all of their loyalty (in contrast to King David, who poured it out before the Lord) to self-aggrandize; you manipulate others into expressing adoration toward you, and you quote them to further your own spiritual mystique. While your life has become less and less admirable, your own self-concept had become greater and greater. Now, the gap between the reality of who you are and the rhetoric surrounding you is so huge that those of us who try to fill that gap with our ""trust"" have been done so only by having our inner faculties damaged, or our ethics compromised.

One of the things that surprised me in the aftermath of the Pastor Andy Lee incident is your blindness to your own sinful contribution to his downfall. You had your long list of villains. I heard you say more than a hundred times that the 2 who were most responsible were P. Paul and Hyekyung SMN. You had your dramatic way of saying this. ""Yi-nam-ha lul mahng-ha-gae-han jang-bon-in-dul."" (이남하 를 망하게한 장본인들) ""You the culprits responsible for ruining Andy Lee"" You never included yourself. But I was there from 1993. I saw you undermining P. Andy, and using all sorts other lowly tactics, talking to people under him, for e.g., to delegitimize and aggravate him. I also saw the extreme frustration he felt toward this entire process; his sense of injustice; his anger; but him feeling stuck, unable to openly speak against you. Clearly, you belong high up on the list of those who contributed to his downfall. But you never repented. You tried to make restitution by helping him, but you never repented for what you did—all the inappropriate and maddening things you did to drive him absolutely up the wall! If you had repented back then, instead of taking solace in Bbong addiction, we would not be in this place today.

Instead of repenting for your wrongs, and the deep character defects from which they arose, you used the entire P. Andy Lee incident to paint a picture of vindication by God, and personal victimization. You emerged from that incident as a victorious warrior—full of wounds for which we should all admire you, and full of pride that you were the victor. I realized then that I was serving a blind leader who does not know how to repent.

Since 1999, it has been slow torture for me. Increasingly, I knew you had gone awry. But I kept trying to see good in you. Your love for people; the fruit in your ministry. But even here, I saw that your love for people was often inconsistent and elitist. And the fruit of your ministry often produced people who were emotionally dependent on your approval. Still, I struggled. I reminded myself of the past; my spiritual indebtedness to you; the times when I felt genuine fondness toward you. And I prayed and hoped that I would be wrong, or that you would repent. But you kept getting worse and my inner conflict grew.

At times I felt I was perpetrating a hoax upon the world; I felt that we were all conspirators engaged in a huge fraud upon our congregation; if they knew what went on, if they were familiar with the true dynamics of the pastoral staff meetings, the ancient-royal-court-like politics of Berkland life, if only they had a camera to see and hear our meetings, what would they think?

Taking care of the Korean Dept, and fighting the San Leandro rebels, getting the building back, all of this was a welcome break from all of this. I could talk to you again over the phone, and we had something to talk about, and we were united against the common enemy. But the issues I had about your leadership, character, and the unhealthy dynamics of our pastoral politics were only put on hold temporarily.

Because you often quote me inaccurately, I want to reiterate in writing some of my problems with your leadership, and the strange, warped world you have created. I do so in the earnest hope that you will take it to heart.

Narcissism.

\- I remember those days in Berkeley, and the early days of Boston, when you were genuinely humble. You were our teacher, our leader, but you did not hold yourself as such a special spiritual specimen (""prophetess"" or ""apostle""), and the distance between us was realistic. Now, this distance has become very very unrealistic. You are the inerrant pope, and we are just peons. We (the other pastors), for our part, play dumb and dull, but the whole thing smacks of the unreality and false ritual of ancient king-to-advisor relationships.

\- Another evidence of your narcissism is your pattern of having long monologues—uninterrupted, unchallenged, the theme of much of which is: ""How great, special, bold, insightful, artistic, interesting, unique I am."" It is actually quite ""min-mahng-hae"" (민망해) pitiable for me to see you talk on and on while all of us sit and listen without saying a word, just providing an audience for your self-fascination. (In fact, many are dozing off, and many others are surfing the net, reading news, checking email, swapping music, etc.) You would think that we would have active discussions among us, sharing our observations from the frontlines of ministry, discussing different approaches, spritual or biblical insights etc. Instead, there is just your monologues.

\- You interpret all events egocentrically. Your birthday, the years of significant events in your life, how they correspond to world events, etc. You even interpret other people's lives according to yourself, even people whose lives intersected with yours briefly, so that the ups and downs of their lives are, at some deep level, due to how they treated you, for example. And you sincerely seem to believe this, and you narrate examples of such things to further your—and our—sense of what a specially anointed person you are. This is a serious imbalance in self-concept.

\- You over-encourage people to give you adoration. You quote with great approval people who have complimented you a long time ago. It's a wonder you don't blush when you do this. You get so upset when credit is not given to you by name. Berkland pastoral practitioners know this very well, so that we scrutinize each testimony to be given at events where you are present to be sure there is sufficient mention of your name.

\- You are selfish. Your insistence that others live according to your very strange schedule of staying up all night, and sleeping until the afternoon (although for many, they need to work the next day) is very selfish and inconsiderate. You talk about detailed love, but seem unconcerned about the extreme stress you are causing, and the chaos you are bringing in the life of others around you who need to twist and bend to your strange schedule, tastes, preferences and whims. If there were a great need to live like this, it would be understandable. But there is really no valid reason for this other than the personal preference of one person. Many suffer. A loving person, according to your own teaching, is sensitive to the pain of others. You are blissfully oblivious, or unconcerned. But maybe you think since it is a privilege to be merely in your presence, all of the strain is worth it for them. Again, this demonstrates a very egocentric person.

\- Your victim complex regarding your marriage is, again, reflective of your narcissism. Most people could not possibly have given the speech you gave in Irvine—a 7-hour, uninterrupted tale of what a victim you are because of P. Paul. There were a lot of details about your honeymoon, and the cheapness of the accommodations you stayed in (pointing out that it was some kind of ""inn"" not a ""hotel.""). As I mentioned above, most people in the Korean immigrant community who got married back then did not even go to a honeymoon, let alone go to Hawaii. I think your expectations regarding your life, which the marriage to P. Paul has crushed, was way overblown to start with. I think you did OK with P. Paul. There are many women in the world (and many younger people in our own congregation) who can tell stories of much greater victimization—yet, without feeling half the self-pity you displayed. Our own mothers had to put up with much more terrible marriages. In fact, you used to say that this is a huge spiritual barrier to Korean women's spiritul growh—that they see themselves as victims of their husbands, and instead of seeing the cross as something caused by their sins, they identify with Christ as a fellow victim and sufferer. But this was exactly the theme of your speech. You said that you live a daily cross-bearing life. I think P. Paul does as well. In fact, the humiliating way you treat P. Paul often borders on the inhumane, and I have sometimes wondered how he manages to tolerate your treatment of him.

I simply could not agree with your tears when you found out that P. Paul knew about the microwave ovens at the rest stops. I think among men, it would be a funny story to tell. Not wanting to be bothered with microwaving the rice, refusing to indulge your princess-like wife, pretending to not notice them: definitely not heroic, or loving, but certainly not something you should have told us with that kind of drama and sense of victimization. Please take a few steps back and listen to your own story. Who can sympathize? But, incredibly, one or two SMNs started crying. Pauline and Philip being embarrassed by their dad's sermon, too: most of us grew up under painfully embarrassing parents. Their lives, and your life, turned out good enough. But good enough is not good enough for you, it seems. Again, I must say: narcissism.

\- You queen-like behavior, expectations regarding how you should be served are also reflective of your narcissistic character. Why should someone else get rebuked for forgetting to bring your ""han-yak""? (한약) oriental medicine Why must so many be nervous about serving you right? Why so picky, and easily annoyed by small inconveniences, like not having cold water readily available for you? How can any right-thinking pastor hold you up as an example of mature christian character?

Dishonesty.

\- Playing Bbong is a prime example. This is done in secret. We hide the fact that this is the major activity of all our pastoral gatherings. But what is also revealing is your constant shifting of excuses for this practice. It started with the strange rationalization that it is because there is nothing else to do with P. Andy. Then, it was ""hyo-bbong."" Then, now, it is ""leadership training."" You also once declared you are banning it. But, you, in fact, never carried out this ""ban"" yourself. This kind of lack of seriousness regarding the truth of what you are saying has been characteristic of you in many ways for many years.

\- Rationalization. The false rhetoric surrounding Bbong is an example of something else you do that represents dishonesty. You are a master at rationalization. But, your rationalizations are very thin, and many of us see through them. For example, when Sally expressed her hurt at our Irvine meeting that you called her ""byung shin"" (병신) a deformed person (a pejorative ""bomb"", severe in all contexts) again and again, you began to acknowledge the fact that you have a ""rough mouth."" But then, you said that the OT prophets also had ""rough mouths."" You said that you were not as bad as the OT prophets. At least you don't tell people that they will eat their own children. As I told you in Irvine, that kind of rationalization offends me. You are no OT prophet, and your rough language is your sinful lack of emotional self-control and your contempt and disregard toward the feelings of others. You need to repent of this, rather than rationalizing your behavior by a comparison to the OT prophets. Please acknowledge your responsibility for the trauma, wound, and damage to self worth you have caused in many. (And please understand why I cannot tell others, without compromising my conscience and damaging their judgment faculties, that your hot temper and abusive language is because you are like one of the OT prophets.)

Again, in Irvine, when Chris mentioned that he felt like he was going crazy in Boston next to you, instead of thinking about your negative leadership which led him to experience this, you said that your main problem was overestimating Chris, thinking he was a higher caliber person, and training him more rigorously. By saying this, you turned a situation where you should have apologized into one in which you emerged as someone who lovingly thought more highly of Chris' potential than he actually had. I mention these two incidents, but of course, this is very characteristic of your after-the-fact rationalizations. Thus, your bad, explosive temper is translated into ""intensity of love"" or ""hard training."" When people get damaged by your outbursts of temper, this is translated (dishonestly) into ""they were not ready"" or that you ""trusted them too much."" This kind of warping of speech, this kind of reversal in the meaning of language, is characteristic of many cultic or other controlling groups (communists, for e.g.).

When I challenged you about your messages, the fact that you are often unprepared, speaking on random topics in a stream-of-consciousness mode, sometimes for an hour, sometimes for the entire message, your response was that Apostle Paul's epistles are also characterized by him discussing this and that without clear organization (""ee-mal, juh-mal"") (이말, 저말) this topic, that topic; literally this word, that word. Then, when I objected to this, you tried another rationalization. You said that you are on a mission to demolish today's christians' common view of a model sermon as a tidy, well-organized presentation. I find it hard to believe that you are doing this out of some prior sense of mission regarding current views on homiletics.

\- Misquoting. You often misquote people, and often in order to divide people from one another—even spouses.

Divisive.

\- You have denigrated Grace, Andy, YB, Peter, etc. in front of me unnecessarily. I am sure you have said similar things about me and Kelly to them. Even in your handling of this incident, although you say you regard us as sons, you had different people call Chris and me (mostly Chris). We ended up arguing. Then you receive reports of our current state of mind through them. Why not just talk to us directly, if you regard us as sons? On the other hand, there are many mothers of dysfunctional families who behave just like this, telling one son to call another son, then report back; criticizing the eldest before the youngest, criticizing the youngest to the middle child, and telling each of them that they are the most special. So to hear that this grieves you most baffles me. Could it really be that you were not aware of your active divisive role among us?

Unhealthy BBC Culture.

\- Flattery, dishonesty, and fear. Many of the people you surround yourself with will not tell you the whole truth. You can do 9 things wrong, and no one will challenge you or offer criticism. But if you do one thing right, they will lavish you with praise. If they will not offer you criticism, they should not give you flattery either. You have become the emperor with no clothes. (But you have fostered this atmosphere yourself.) For example, you have heard many say something like: ""Oh, why don't we close down our churches, and all of us move to Boston?"" I know for a fact that people do not want to move to Boston. Yet they say this. And you seem to believe it.

Chris and I have, over the years, received many requests by our peers to communicate something to you, or ask for something, that they were afraid to do directly. When, in the middle of some other discussion, I am able to bring it up casually, and get your permission or agreement, I then bring this happy news to whoever asked me, much to their relief. This is how people relate to you.

After Daegu, one of the pastors was quick to try to take back some things he said, lest what he said be quoted to you. He had told Chris that his wife had been depressed for a week after the recent SMN retreat in Boston, but he denied any knowledge of this. One of the other pastors admitted to me that he thinks that at times our church is like a ""personality cult."" But he also said that he would never be able to say it to you in public. He told me that he thinks he can tell you this in private. (I seriously doubt it). There has been remarkable silence from all my friends after Daegu, and, even a greater silence after Irvine. If I am wrong, you would think they would call to challenge me, or convince me, or rebuke me. If I am right, or even partially so, you would think they would say I agree with you on some points, and disagree on others. I am baffled, and disappointed at my friends. Certainly, our rhetoric about our famous friendships is far off the mark.

\- There is very little real relationship-forming going on among the pastors and, certainly, hardly any among the SMNs at our church. People rarely talk to one another. Like once-close friends becoming distant and suspicious after the onset of communism in their land, our friendships have stood still, or regressed. We have become mutually wary in the environment of fear and taboo created by your leadership. Yet, our rhetoric about it continues unabated, in disregard of reality.

\- Defensive ministry. For many BBC pastors, your approval means everything. But since it is often not clear what will displease you, given your moodiness, spontaneity, and unpredictability, playing it safe is at a premium. No one wants to hear you say: ""Is this a Berkland church?"" But what is the core of our ministry? This is ill defined. But it is, in fact, the person of JDSN; i.e., it is whatever you say it is depending on your latest thoughts. But this is often changing according to your latest trip, or your latest conversation with someone. There is no fixed set of principles that we have defined as our core values. So people practice defensive ministry. They do things that they see you doing, or they do things that were approved in the past. This is a very stifling experience for most.

\- Cynicism toward ministry. One of the alarming things about you in the past few years has been your growing cynicism toward ministry. ""People don't change."" ""Why devote out time to people who don't change, when we should spend time with our kids?"" You seemed to have lost confidence in the power of the word. We never crack open the Bible when we meet for days. Because of this cynicism toward ministry, you seemed resolved to just fellowship and ""build relationships""—mostly by hanging out and engaging in fun, secular activities. Therefore, our ministry has been stagnant and in maintenance-mode for quite some time now.

\- Unhealthy view of marriage. As yet another example of up being down, and right being left in your world, happily married couples are made to feel apologetic for it. Their happy marriage is not, of course, a result of anything like emotional maturity, but a lack of commitment to truth, or a lack of spirituality by which the spouses are satisfied with each other. This is very unhealthy indeed, and has caused actual damage to many marriages throughout BBC.

\- Lack of real leadership. You have not provided real leadership for years now. You have not dealt with XYZ and many other needy and troubled staff. Your solution seems to be to just keep moving them around, each time necessitating a fresh round of deceitful announcements to our congregations. Clearly, you have reached the limit of your own leadership abilities a long time ago. Like the majority of ancient royalty, you exercise total power, demand homage, but provide very little actual guidance, mentoring or inspiration.

\- Increasing secularity, and secrecy. We have betrayed our message regarding many things. I still remember how a few of our sophomores—I think it was Warren and some of his friends—were severely rebuked by Andy and Grace for going to Noraebang (노래방) karaoke. Now, we, the pastors, do. And the obsessive and secretive playing of a game associated with the lowest of activities among Koreans--the game itself, and the extent of playing are utterly scandalous. We have also betrayed our messages, and former stance regarding movies and regarding Korean videos. Oh, how we used to revile people who would watch hours and hours of these videos, many of them running 30 hours or more. And you rationalize all of this—fellowship, understanding our congregation, education, etc.

I can go on and on in this vein, but I think this letter is long enough.

Given all of the above, and more, I cannot, in good conscience, lead others who follow me into the strange and warped world in which you must be adored, followed, feared, and set up as a super-spiritual christian model, where common sense must be abandoned in order to believe all of your rationalizations, and your practices be imitated, and your moods and hot temper suffered. I think this breaks people. It is a wrong I cannot continue to perpetuate. By my mere presence, people assume a lot. They are entitled to this assumption—the assumption that I am not a fool, that I would hold up the truth, that I would apply the same standards toward myself and my leaders as I would to them, that I am an ethical pastor of integrity. Therefore, any reservations they have toward you become supressed by my (and the others') mere presence as a BBC pastor in full support of you and all that goes on in BBC. I refuse to continue to play part in the deceit, the fraud we are perpetuating upon the public, and upon our congregation. Personally, me and Kelly felt at times that we were going insane dealing with all of this over the years. No one else should ever be asked to go through this.

I plan on vacating the Alcatraz building as soon as we find suitable office space to lease, and taking other steps to finalize my break with your leadership. After that telephone conversation with you, I decided that there would be no point in holding off until January. I don't think the September 7th meeting you suggested to Chris is really necessary, since many things depend on you and you alone. After much thinking and prayer, I realized that for me and Kelly to simply leave, or a subset of our leadership to move to another city, would be an unconscionable abandonment of our sheep. I don't think I could live with such a decision. Therefore, I decided that I must stay in this area, and minister to those who will follow my leadership apart from BBC. I know I will have to offer them some explanation. I cannot lie and say that I am resigning because of stress, or for personal reasons, or any other such made up reasons. Nor can I tell them that BBC leadership is healthy, and all of them should follow you. That would be wrong. I will try to keep it as general as possible, for the sake of the sheep as well as to protect your legacy as much as possible. I have very little to gain, and much to lose practically by doing this—the hurt and shock this will bring to so many, including my own children, being reviled as worse than P. Andy Lee, the painful loss of all my friendships. It may be the hardest thing I will ever do.

I still miss how you used to be. I miss the old Berkland that I fell in love with. The old Berkland that I committed my life to. Our old values of radical discipleship, counter-cultural community, covenantal relationships, focus on the Word, missional mindset, the faith we once had that we would change the world, that we would raise disciples to become our co-workers, co-builders of the kingdom. I miss the spirit of freedom we had in relating to one another, sharpening each other, arguing, debating, and loving each other. We were unselfconscious, and had nothing to lose during those days, when we did not care so much about the Berkland name, when we all still had our distinct personalities and strengths, when all things seemed possible. I still have huge nostalgia for those days, and long for their return. I know that all the best of what God has done among us has not been entirely destroyed; just overshadowed. I have been praying for the shadow to lift, and for the good things to return, and will continue to do so.

I regret the tone of this letter. I went over it to tone it down several times. English sounds so cold, and my criticisms were not softened with roundabout expressions. But the letter was not written without prayer—often with tears—toward you. I believe it to be an act of love toward you. I will continue to hope and pray for that day when we can enjoy one another's company, when all the Berkland pastors can be friends again. I am sure it will take time, but still, I want to hold out the hope that we will grow old together. In heaven, in the light of fuller truth, I may owe you an apology. But this side of heaven, I believe I've done my best.

With prayers,

Ed Kang"

cults,lc7d94,I think my best friend growing up was part of the Unification Church,"Ok so this is kind of a long story and I’ll try to keep it as brief as I can. 

When I was in first grade I had a best friend, let’s call her Mary. Mary had a sister, Jane. We were friends from first grade until we went to different middle schools and we kept in touch until high school. I say all this to preface this story with the fact that I was a child and memory is a funky thing. 

I have been trying to figure out this families weird religion for years. I was young and obviously didn’t absorb the kind of information I need to do research. I just have always had a weird feeling about them, but all I knew was:
- She wasn’t allowed to date; Talking about boys in her house was pretty much forbidden
- She was going to have an arranged marriage and was pretty excited about it. Her true parents were supposed to pick for her (I assumed she meant her literal parents)
- They had pictures of this Asian couple (who I now think were the Moon’s) all over their house. I thought this was super weird bc they’re Italian 
- When I asked who the couple was they said they were their “true parents” which I just shrugged off as a bit odd - I forgot the phrase completely until today and it didn’t click about the marriage thing (again I was a kid)
- I’m pretty sure the reason we didn’t go to the same middle school is that she was homeschooled, I’m not positive. 
-The last time I saw her was freshman year of high school for Jane’s funeral. We were told to wear all white and had a “celebration of life.” There was a video tribute to her, musical performances from friends and family, and a send off to heaven by a religious leader (again, a small little Asian man; cue me being confused but letting it go).

All that was a bit odd, but I didn’t have enough to figure it out and when I said “pictures of a little old Asian couple” everyone I knew who wanted to help was lost. 

This brings us to today:
I was watching a documentary and they started talking about the Unification Church. They said the phrase “true parents” and something clicked. I was like “holy shit I’ve heard that before.” I started researching and realized a lot of their weird quirks kind of lined up. AND the funeral (the last time I ever saw her) was Summer 2012. Right before Rev. Moon died. So here I am 2 hours later ranting to the only subreddit this seemed remotely appropriate for. Am I crazy? Have I made this whole thing up or does it sound like I really grew up with a friend in a cult?"

cults,lawzep,i grew up in a cult and i’m only now realizing the magnitude of death,"death for me was never something i was afraid of. i didn’t cry when my grandfather died. i spread his ashes without a second thought. 
i grew up with a hope forced upon me that i would see my dead relatives again and that i would live forever with them soon. the entire aspect of death was really put into perspective this year when i started questioning my beliefs. it took not long on the internet to see that the religion i was brought up in is a cult. everything came crashing down. 
i had so many beliefs and hopes that were all just proven entirely wrong by some guy on the internet. i felt so guilty. i harmed myself every time i thought of somthing that would conflict the beliefs i was brought up with, i did not want to believe it. 
i did more research and the first emotion i felt was anger. i had my childhood practically taken from me, i wasn’t able to have friends. i was taught that i needed to preach or i will not live forever, which cost me my social life. i was an outcast. not only that i grew up being compared every second of every day. i was walking on eggshells and i felt disgusted whenever i though of somthing that contradicted my religion. 
it hurts me so much that i have never truly mourned my grandfather. i know that sounds cruel and i don’t wish the death of an family member upon anyone. but when my grandpa i genuinely felt almost grateful that my grandpa died just because in my mind death was just a stage of life. almost everyone goes through it and they come out the other side where life is perfect. 
i was also told that i would have no more illness. something that’s really f’ed up and no matter how i looked at it it rubbed me the wrong way is that they said my brother would be “cured” of his autism. i personally never ever saw anything wrong with his autism and the fact that they said it had to be cured made me and still makes me angry.
growing up as a [redacted, because i’m not comfortable sharing although i’m sure you could guess], you were only taught conditional love. i have a hard time accepting that people can love me when i don’t do everything perfect. when i have the occasional bad thought. if i do i am not worthy of love.
and that is how they want you to be, they want you to be afraid. they use fear tactics to indoctrinate children. when you ask why you cannot do something it’s because god/his angels wouldn’t let you through to paradise. they would often show you gruesome pictures of their depiction  of armageddon. honestly i don’t know where i was getting at with this post
but i cried for the very first time in nearly five years since my grandfathers passing and i feel awful. all these emotions of grief are coming in at once i feel so incredibly guilty i didn’t spend the remaining days my grandpa had left with him, and that i didn’t mourn him. i love you so much grandpa and i’m so sorry i didn’t get to cherish our relationship when you were alive.

i’m very sorry for the errors in here, i’m not good at writing and this was moreso a rant. if you have any questions i’d be more then welcome to answer

cults,lafde9,"Rosa Lena Cole. Disappeared after running away from Synanon Cult rehabilitation center. 1973. Oakland, California.","**Name:**[ Rose Lena Cole](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2368dfca.html)

**Case Classification:** Endangered Missing

**Missing Since:** July 1, 1973

**Location Last Seen:** Oakland, Alameda County, California

Ms. Cole ran away from a Synanon Foundation facility in Oakland, California, an institution that treated persons suffering from alcohol and drug abuse, where she was sent in 1972 by a Michigan judge when caught using drugs. She wrote to her family while she was there, and ran away sometime toward the end of 1972. She sent a letter in early February 1973 from an unknown location; that was the last time anyone heard from her. On January 4, 1974, a petition to the court of Michigan was granted to drop all charged against Ms. Cole.

The Synanon Foundation was founded by Charles Dederich, Sr. in 1958 as a rehabilitation center for both drug and alcohol addicts. Its headquarters was originally in Santa Monica, California, but as it gained popularity and wealth over the years, it had chapters in other California counties, Detroit, and as far away as Germany and Malaysia. Over the years, Synanon became a utopian society/ cult not unlike Jim Jones' Peoples Temple. Dederich declared Synanon a religion in 1974 and was forced to give up operations of Synanon when he pled no contest to conspiracy to commit murder in 1978.

**Rose’s** [**Letters:**](https://whereaboutsstillunknown.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/rose-cole/)

(Letters shown at above link)

Rose sent a couple more letters home from Chinatown in San Francisco. These letters expressed some fear of being found by Synanon and brought back.

She mentioned a girl named Ruth who she had become friends with, and a man named Rick, who she disliked. (A Women claiming to be Ruth can be found in the comment section of [this](https://whereaboutsstillunknown.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/rose-cole/) website.)

She no longer signed her full name, but only her initials. In her last letter, she said she would not be contacting her family again until she turned 18 and could not be ordered back to Synanon.

She additionally stated that she was staying in a big house with an older couple, and that she’d contracted a kidney infection.

The last letter was written on her sixteenth birthday, December 23, 1972. It was not mailed until February 3, 1973 – she’d added a note saying she’d just gotten a stamp. This is the last positive contact we have from her.

A court document dated January 1974 was located, which was a dismissal of all charges against Rose. The document strongly implies that Rose was present at this court date, but her family members all denied that she was in fact present. This document suggests that Cole appeared in court with an adult, but who?

**Theories:**

1. Synanon Killed Her

* [Violent](https://www.oxygen.com/deadly-cults/crime-news/synanon-cult-attempts-murder-paul-morantz-rattlesnake) cult like organization.
* Went missing from their facility.
* Synanon connection to Marin County, California. The Organization owned as much as ⅓ of the county. Syanon built its first major city (Tomales Bay) in 1964. On January 6th 1973 a [Jane Doe](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/11798?nav) was found in Marin County.
* Did Synanon forge or withhold the letters then send them at a later date ?
* Why did she stop signing her full name ?
* Delay and final letter due to murder ?
* Jane Doe could be unrelated, and her body was dumped elsewhere.

[Jane Doe](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/11798?nav)

Date Body Found: January 6, 1973

Location Found: Marin County, California

Height: 5' 8""-6' 0""(68-72 inches) Estimated

Skeletal remains, believed to be a female in her late teens/young adult, were found by hikers on Mt. Talmapias.

1. **Decided to not contact her family.**

* Either died on the streets or Moved on with her life.
* She had a complex relationship with her family.
* San Francisco had a violent underbelly at the time.
* Possible she survived but didn't want to contact family.

1. **Victim of the Santa Rosa**[ **HitchHiker**](http://www.santarosahitchhikermurders.com/) **killer**

* A series of at least seven murders in the North Bay, California area, the Santa Rosa Hitchhiker Murders occurred between 1972 and 1973. The female victims of these murders were all found nude in rural areas near steep embankments, or in creek beds along a roadside. Originally, it was thought that there were only seven victims in the case, who ranged in ages from 12 to approximately 23 years old. However, the FBI released a report in 1975 claiming that there were a series of fourteen connected homicides, which included the original seven Santa Rosa Hitchhiker murders. The cause of death for victims was typically asphyxiation due to being strangled with a cord of some nature.

1. Possible LA [Doe](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/4463?nav)

Date Body Found: September 5, 1973

Location Found: LA Habra Heights, California

Estimated Age Range: 14-20 Years

* On 9/6/1973 the decedent was found in an open grave in La Habra Heights, CA.
* Found with Gold and Blue peace sign earrings. (San Francisco was a popular site for these to be sold, however they were popular across the country.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to give you some background:

These encounters were 5-10 years apart.

The first member who I recognized from before said that he was a sponsee of Clancy and had attended the Pacific Group. He has a socially dominant position within the AA community here.

Here is some background on Clancy cult accusation: [https://www.google.com/search?q=clancy+pacific+group+cult&amp;oq=clancy+pacific+group+cult&amp;aqs=chrome..69i64j69i57j69i60.736j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=clancy+pacific+group+cult&amp;oq=clancy+pacific+group+cult&amp;aqs=chrome..69i64j69i57j69i60.736j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)

The second person wanted to sponsor me both times. She was odd and cruel towards her son, so I declined.

I got to know the third fairly well, but she never mentioned having been involved with AA before.

&amp;#x200B;

So, sure this could be a paranoid delusion, but it's not. I don't know what to make of it. I am absolutely certain that I encountered these same three people back in the LA area and that they moved to my area. I have no evidence to support that they moved here because of me and I don't necessarily think that it is the case. I am trying to dissect the elements of this and the memories to find some answer.

I was wondering if there might be a Scientology connection or something with AA because cults are known to stalk members, sending people after those who leave. There is also a parallel in the ""getting clean"" philosophy between the two groups. Most other solutions fail to explain the situation. However, these members did not come to find me. Rather, I met them at a meeting I went to of my own volition. This does not fit the stalking model of Scientology. 

&amp;#x200B;"
cults,l6me9m,Scientology &amp; Alcoholics Anonymous Connected?,"Is anyone aware of a connection between Scientology and Alcoholics Anonymous? This is going to sound very strange, but I had attended AA meetings in one town and later moved to another town. I met three of the same people there. I have been asking myself if this is a coincidence or if it's possible high level AA members are somehow connected to Scientology. Scientology has a history of following individuals who try to leave. I can't think of any other possible reasons for this happening. AA is very cult like including specialized language, encouragement of cutting ties with people and love bombing new members. The inventory can be used as a means of gathering information and blackmailing people who aren't subservient."

cults,l44b7b,Do 'anonymous recovery' groups more closely resemble a 'scam' or 'cult?' Are there legitimate resources available for survivors?,"I understand that the definitions can get muddy, and there is no universal agreement on the constitution of the terms I've employed. Further, members of harmful groups who, perhaps, perpetrate fraud or aim to grow communities within the framework of a common scam or fringe subculture, will nearly universally deny the harmful realities of their group while justifying and promoting their tactics. That being said, I am not posting this for the sake of argument, i.e. I have posted my questions legitimately as a premise for a working definition based on agreement with my assertion. 

In my working definition, anonymous groups are an imminent threat to society and quite dangerous, thus I humbly suggest that anyone jumping upon my questions to promote or defend these groups may, please, kindly refrain from commenting likewise.

If you are a member, or merely believe in the efficacy of these groups enough to discuss them on reddit, there is no shortage of space for you to praise them here, or on another post or sub. Frankly, reddit is loaded with subs for a wide range of secular subcultures, multi level marketing and entrepreneurship schemes, and anonymous support groups as well as fringe and mainstream religions, so please, spare your arguments on this post.

The primary aim of my inquiry is to determine if these groups more closely resemble a multi level marketing 'scam' or a religious 'cult.' Additionally, I'd like to know how people have recovered from these groups through the lens that they represent a predatory variety of alleged 'recovery,' mostly for the sake of knowing if there are any legitimate and/or government resources that recognize the dangers of these groups seeking to provide recovery resources. 

I am well aware that there is no shortage of people that have suffered in anonymous groups, and it is quite rare to find any particular person aside from their members, associates, and beneficiaries, that is willing to vouch for them. Further, they have been labeled as a scam or cult in a vast array of outlets in media, film, and popular culture. All primary indicators point to an overwhelming majority of people with experience in any form of anonymous group viewing their practices as intrusive and harmful. 

Nonetheless, there seems to be a lack of resources for people to escape the influence of the groups themselves. Further, the organization, funding, and public relations efforts of the varying groups themselves seems to be widely positive, and quite good. While there is no shortage of complaints and horror stories about the groups, these are often not accompanied by the same or a similar echo chamber, often appearing to be the product of one dissenting opinion coming from a crazy person straight out of the peanut gallery. I know that it is not really the case, and these groups are widely unpopular among most ordinary people. Despite this, most do not voice enough harm done to the extent that they'd be willing to take particular initiative to expose or question the efficacy of such an approach. As mentioned, legally and technically, such an approach may or may not definitively constitute major racketeering and fraud. These are serious crimes, so, assuming that I am not merely naïve to a plethora of existential resources to recover from anonymous scam and/or cult communities, why aren't there more recovery resources, and what exactly are these groups to begin with?"

cults,l41iu5,How do you learn about *everything* after being raised in a cult?,"Hi all,

I’m a 20 YOM who grew up within a cult.  My parents never allowed me to consume any media without their permission and went to great lengths to keep me sheltered from the world.  I was always taught that those who learned about issues of popular culture (through tv, books, sports, etc) were idolaters, and I didn’t have regular access to the whole unrestricted internet until I moved off to college at 18.

Growing up, I never realized I was in a cult.  The majority of my school years were spent with peers from similar upbringings.  Now that I’ve spent a couple years at college, I’ve realized that I know literally nothing about pop culture.  I’m familiar with American politics and most main-stream in-person stores and brands, but aside from that I’m clueless. 

I’ve recently began learning about sports, music, and television..... but it’s a lot to try to take it all in.  I’d like to know how to quickly get a basic understanding of *everything* so that I can have a better understanding of what my friends are talking about.

Of course, I know how to Google topics and read Wikipedia.  But there’s so much that I’ve never even heard of and I don’t know how to learn about things until after my friends have already had a conversation about it.  It would be great to be able to actively participate in a conversation that isn’t about school work, politics, or religion.  

Do you all have recommendations so that I can learn about everything?"

I also hope to add a section that is updated weekly with testimonials from survivors. This could be anything from experiences in the group or life after leaving it. The aim is the give others the chance to realise they aren’t alone in their choice to move away from their sect.

All perfectly normal, but there's a weird vibe to the whole thing.  She (my relative) and her husband planned the entire ceremony and even picked out a wedding dress solely with their friends from the organization.  No family members were included at any point, but of course she still expected them to pick up the tab.  And when she gave birth, she didn't tell her family until several days later.  So I could be reading into things, but all of this combined with her blithe demeanor make me concerned for her.  

I would feel much more at ease if I could tell if she is being manipulated or if she's just living her life.  I attended her college as well and I always got a weird vibe about the group's level of dedication. She spent much of her time in the campus organization trying to get donations out of family and friends so she could pay people to go on various retreats and missionary projects.  Has anyone spent time invested in a campus religious group?  Do they try to get money out of members or manipulate family ties?"

I always wondered why he said that he can’t remember much at all from his childhood, and now it makes sense in such a heartbreaking way.
In his own words, he suffered every type of abuse imaginable, including sexual abuse.

Now that those memories are all flooding back, he is consumed with anger and having malicious thoughts towards his abusers. He’s also said this experience has caused him to look at himself differently.

And for those who are wondering if he’s receiving help, he’s in therapy, but he’s looking for a new therapist who has experience helping survivors of cults. He also attends NA (due to past addiction, which also makes sense now).

cults,kzeiv8,Trying to figure out what religious group/cult/ organization/ influencer my family member has become taken in by. A major belief seems to be promoting morbid obesity as ‘accepting God’s bounty’.,"A member of my family, in his mid 30s, has recently become very vocal about some new beliefs and has been promoting some pseudo Christian ideas about God providing what you need and that morbid obesity is what God wants for you.  He’s about 5’10” and weighed about 350lbs but has noticeably gained almost 100lbs in the last 6 months and appears to be getting close to 500lbs.  He had been previously considering gastric bypass but now has whole heartily embraced the idea that God wants us to be as big as his bounty will allow.  I am very concerned because his health has declined rapidly with the weight gain and he struggles to breathe just sitting in a chair.  
He’s mentioned things like accepting the bounty God provides, obesity not actually causing health problems and that doctors are lying, that some ambiguous ‘they’ want you to deprive yourself because that’s what actually makes you sick, God wants us to all be obese (that’s why obesity rates are so high) and that it’s actually evil influence that makes you think it’s bad, God promised a harvest, we possess the land and in God’s kingdom we will all be able to indulge in his gifts.  
There’s a very strong Christian component to his new beliefs.  I can’t seem to find what group or church might be promoting this to him.  I know he’s also very involved in Q anon, which I know very little about, but maybe something there led him down a rabbit hole to this.  Are there any YouTube channels, influencers, cults, etc...that mention obesity as a sort of religious thing?  I want to figure out where this is coming from so I can see what they’re saying and maybe find a way to get a person he respects (like his church pastor) to refute some of this."

Are Those Who Create This Moral Panic Just Trying to Make People Conform To Shallow MainStream Beliefs &amp; Values?","What if cults were just minority subcultures within our mainstream culture, and all the 50 year old atrocity stories that keep getting repeated about them are simply hucksterisms &amp; attempts to scare you into conformity?

Just as a very small percentage of criminals exist in every population, while the overwhelming majority of people are peaceful and good, doesn't this ratio pertain to those who follow minority religions as well?

In my experience, if you scratch the surface on most anticultists and 'cult experts' driving this moral panic, you will find adherents to mainstream beliefs such as Jews, Christians &amp; Atheists acting out their own economic and ideological motivations for scaring people about 'cults'.

What if they are trying to create this moral panic in you simply because 'cults' believe differently than they do? What if they simply have books to sell, podcasts to get advertisers for, or psychological practices to market, or their on worldviews and congregations to protect?

Jonestown happened.  Aum Shinrikyo existed. Heavens Gate was real. But so was Masada. And the Catholic Church has literally had 100s of years of global cover ups of institutionalized pedophilia that is only now beginning to be criminally prosecuted in the US.

Why is the focus on minority religions, and not on the specific individuals who commit specific criminal acts - no matter their religion, minority or mainstream?

Religious persecution is real. It exists in all times and places in our species. But if you use the ""C"" Word, nobody recognizes it, and they think the persecution is justified.

I was recruited by a friend to join a bible study a few years ago. I was not told the name of the bible study group until a few months into the course, which I later found out is called Shincheonji. It's a group started in Korea. The bible study started with topics typical to bible studies you would attending discussing topics such as God, Jesus, Sin, baptism, being saved, serving God, tithing etc. Slowly over a few months, the focus changed from understanding the parables in the bible to interpreting the book of revelation. The way they read the bible is like a decoding message. Like water means the word of God because from this parable it said this etc. 

The bible study teaches that we have to know the meaning of the parables and be able to hear the teaching of the book of Revelation taught by their leader/ prophet (Lee Man Hee) to be able to receive salvation. Because of the way they teach the bible, I was fully convinced that that was the truth of the bible. If you want to find out more about this bible study, there's a subreddit or just search on google. There are lots of Youtube videos and blogs about it. 

This church targets young adults in university campuses and sometimes they would join local churches, make friends and then bring them to this bible study over time. The group is very secretive and sometimes you could have friends, siblings and children in the group and you would not know. They control what members read and believe such as the news paper and internet. They try and isolate you from your family and friends after you join. 

I just want to take this chance to raise awareness about control groups and coercive control. Here's a table called the BITE model and it's useful in helping people decide if they are in a cult. I used to think cult is just ""different doctrine"". Now I know that is not the case. I really hope that every church and university religious group would educate their members about the BITE model and cults to spare them from the pain an experience like this can cause. If you guys can share more information about cults and the BITE model among the Christian community on facebook, that would be so great.

These two people are psychic predators and Vampires who attempt to own you, control you, and brainwash you into being their puppet slaves. Not to mention physically, mentally, and emotionally harm you.

How I joined. One night, as I was heading to bed. I felt a VERY large entity land on my bed. It entered my body and a bright white light appeared before me. It told me to surrender to the white light. As a spiritual seeker and naive to possibility of manipulation I surrendered to it thinking ooh weeh! A white light! I surrendered and yes had a pleasant experience, swirling colors divine feeling. 

But the entity remained and the stigma behind possession made me to research into this. A year or so had went by, seeing shamans, dealing with demonic entities in my sleep. Growing, and learning but at the same time still confused and seeking answers to this experience. That's when I came across this from the ASCENSIONGLOSSARY.COM

""It is a false white light current (aka False Christ Consciousness light used by the Imposter Spirit) that is sourcing and manipulated from the lower Soul Matrix dimensional realms. This False White Light creates an intricate webbing with many Alien Implants and bio-neurological Mind Control technology which is exerted upon the human's Soul body and mind (through use of lower frequency wave manipulation) of the human being""
Stay with me, you've read this and already consumed some next level bull shit. 

But, this false white light being used by the imposter Spirit is pretty spot on to my experience. It's explains the white light it explains the entity.

I contacted Lisa about this experience and she said it was good that I ""sourced this artificial alien technology"". I was then offered to join into ESfoundations.com

Shortly after I received an email from Joseph Machney. This is another leader in this cult. He said he could remove this ""false white light structure"". I was skeptical and denied at first. Although these people have a way of wording things that is super manipulative. Eventually I had an energy session with this man... He put in some wierd etheric structure and replaced the false white light with the help of his ""beloveds"". After this session I started losing my shit. Weird entities all around me constantly. At night when I sleep  . Waking up seeing cameras in my third eye and in my room. Which is their form of remote viewing and spying.  Capturing information from your mind to use against you and make you seem schizophrenic. I stayed with for about 2-3 weeks. Before eventually running the fuck away. I had two more session with this guy. I was scared. I was confused. I thought I could trust him. I didn't know. But yeah those energy sessions cause direct psychosis... I self admitted to a psych ward. I was suffering from neurosis and psychosis.  Went back and had one last session. Because I was still unsure and hadn't put the pieces together yet.
Told him about it. His response was ""You're being thrown around like a ragdoll"". Not an ounce of empathy or compassion. 

Now heres the truth. These energy sessions are a one way trip to psychosis and brainwash city. I don't know what they do with this energy but it ain't good.

 They say they have these ""Benevolent Beings"" working for them called the ""Defenders of Truth Soverignty and Liberation"". They are supposedly ultra terrestrial beings. These beings supposedly ""contacted"" lisa Renee and downloaded her with all the information found on Ascension Glossary. Now are these actually beings?? I don't believe so.

 I believe this is simply a warehouse of other people's STOLEN ENERGY manifested into form. That's what lisa does. She steals energy and has created this entire separate reality. They manifest and manipulate this energy into all sorts of shit including this ""Grid"" and these etheric structures and these alien entities. How exactly? I'm not sure. And I think it's better I didn't know. I am not a psychic predator nor do I have the desire to manipulate energy and reality. 

Let me explain further. These people are energy vampires they take from you and will leave you feeling with their shitty, depressed, Narcissistic, Sociopathic energy. They specifically target people who are on the path of Kundalini, as kundalini is the stronger of energy. But they will take chi and prana energy if you let them. Here's an explanation from ascension glossary. Of course, she blames the aliens for this stealing energy dynamic. 

""As a result of the human body and human consciousness being such an abundant supply of Potential Energy and kinetic energy, the NAA have found many parasitic methods in which to harvest this collective energy yield for their benefit, to the detriment of humanity. Humans and the earth body have an incredible supply of many forms of potential energy that are being collected through Bio-Spiritual Harvesting methods. These methods are found in many standard practices that are socially accepted, because most people are completely unaware of the damage this generates in the electromagnetic field of human beings, both in the physical body and in the spiritual body.""

They will create 100s of tiny teeny tendrils and attach them to your body to suck your life force. This is subtle. Sometimes you may not realize they are in your system. It took me a while to realize it. The not so subtle attack is to your third eye and root chakra. They mess with your mind and steal kundalini from your root chakra.

And now mind control. What they love. Creating chords and attacking your third eye. Putting images and thought forms in there. but oh no it's not Lisa Renee that's doing this. It's the ALIENS!! 

These people are sick. ""SEXUAL MISERY"" is where they put images of loved ones in your brain. They don't exclude children or anyone. When your going to sleep is when they love to attack. When your brain waves are just right your body actually reacts in a certain way to the imagery being put in. And because you're barely conscious it's harder to defend yourself. IE. They love to send pictures of food or drinks to your third eye because when you're in those brain waves, your mouth actually reacts as if it's trying to consume them. Or they put images of you about to fall of a cliff and your body will wake up in a shock thinking it's actually falling.
They love making your body feel like it's tripping too. This is literally physical abuse... And of course being raped in your sleep by the leaders who are astral projecting... 

I am putting this information out there to INFORM people on the truth. Not only is the spiritual but also physical abuse. 

As a member of esfoundations.com you are an ""Acupuncture point"" for this Grid. You go on ""Missions"" against the ""Negative Aliens"". During this time. This leader will brainwash the shit out of you. Use entities and put them in your energy field. Weird shit, like bees, bugs, demons, they even had these ""masked beings"" that were some evil looking things wearing FACEMASKS when then coronavirus was starting.  And then will tell you, it's because of your negative ego (that they are manipulating btw)  that you're attracting these beings. And then you pay for someone to ""clear them"" and an ""energy upgrade"" which is again wooh another brainwashing session. Many innocent people in es foundations believe Lisa Renee is a saint an angel and a savior.

I remember seeing a post in the forums titled
"" Doubts about ES IMPLANT""
No no darling that is no alien or etheric implant. That is your intuition telling you to run the fuck away.

It is sad to see. And they are slowly being completely brainwashed untill they find the truth of the matter. Which is ENERGETIC SYNTHESIS MEMBERS ARE PSYCHIC PREDATORS. People who have spent too much time in esfoundations will be completely delusional from the amount of reframing, mind control, and brainwashing, being done. 

Once you realize that it's a cult, and they are all psychic predators, congrats! You have graduated from esfoundations and you're invited to join energetic synthesis and sell your soul to this women. Oh but a deposit is required ( Obviously) I'd advise against it... Unless unecesary negative karma, suffering, having no free will, and satan directing your life, and watching people suffer is something you enjoy.

Lisa Renee is not an Ascension guide as she so claims. 
She is a narcissistic sociopath. She is a megalomaniac. She encourages you to kill yourself while trying to make you seem schizophrenic. And she enjoys it. She will manipulate you like a puppet and try to get you to work for her.

I remember sleeping one night and just thinking I don't want to be alive anymore. I had a dream where she was setting off fireworks and celebrating that.

Unfortunately after being abused and sleep raped by this women for months on end I've gotten to know her a little to well. Don't think I've had a night of sleep without her invading me for a year now. Dreams about her wrapping 1000s of her black tentacles around me like medusa. Dreams are important. They actually clone themselves in the dreams to make it seem like they are your family members or co workers or friends. To manipulate you even while you're dreaming. 
 
For everyone on a spiritual path, practice some sort of psychic self defense. White light of protection and reflective shields. 

If you feel someone intruding into your third eye imagine something reflective, a spoon, a security vest, shiny keys, reflective shades or a lock. Put a strong NO. Or stay AWAY. And return to sender. 

 As far as the entity is concerned, fuck it. If it's still there it doesn't control me. These people do not control me!!  Possession isn't real. No one owns you but you. 

I am a Soverign being. If I wanted to be a victim I'd say I'm possessed and this entity and these people are controlling me.

MY BODY IS MINE, MY MIND IS MINE. MY ENERGY IS MINE

The stronger you get the better. I feel them poking at me sometimes but it's nothing like it was before. 

I am in cult recovery therapy and CBT. And making loads of progress every day. Mind you, I was only in esfoundations for 3 weeks. Imagine the damage done to people who take two years to realize what's going on....

I have submitted a tip to the FBI requested an investigation be opened into this. 

I have contacted ICSA and requested they put this cult in this list of groups. ( As of now it is not)

Please stay away from this garbage. Please spread the word. This is abuse in every sense of the word. Mental, emotional, Spiritual, and physical. 

They will use your loved ones and family members against you. They will try to turn your friends against you. 

Hoping this will help anyone. If you have been affected by these people please feel free to reach out. Please do the same thing I did. Contact the FBI and submit a tip. Contact the ISCA.com get them to recognize this cult. TELL YOUR STORY! These people are criminals and are no worse than murderers, and serial killers. They deserve to be sent to prison and obviously god knows where they're going when they die. That or their next lifetime is going to be utterly pleasent for them!! :) Sarcasm 

I was put through this to expose them. That is my job. I did not go through this for no reason at all. These people need to be EXPOSED. 

The two major names I know are
Lisa Renee
Joseph Machney

With gratitude to be in this position of understanding. To be able to expose someone so crooked and evil."

cults,kxxiji,"Did your ""Cult"" use Luke 14:26 or Matt 10:37 to separate you from your family? Essentially the idea that if you love your family more than God then you aren't worthy of God.","&gt;Luke 14:26 - “If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.”

and

&gt;Matthew 10:37 - ""He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.”

This is a Christian Bible theme that is commonly used by coercive groups to induce members to cut themselves off from their non-member families.

Here is how my group used it:

Mormons:

&gt;The challenge we may confront is remaining loyal to the Savior and His Church in the face of parents, in-laws, brothers or sisters, or even our children whose conduct, beliefs, or choices make it impossible to support both Him and them. It is not a question of love. We can and must love one another as Jesus loves us. As He said, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”26 But, the Lord reminds us, “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.” So although familial love continues, relationships may be interrupted and, according to the circumstances, even support or tolerance at times suspended for the sake of our higher love.

Many might not regard this as a cult but it's either a cult or damn close.

Largest rehab facility in Europe at the time.

Documentary Is on Netflix it's originally in Italian but the English Dub is very good.

This was a time period when how drug addicts should be rehabilitated was still fairly experimental. Not saying it's great now however.

Addicts could not leave the facility they had to escape, and he would capture addicts and bring them back.

They did discharge patients but you were a prisoner till they said its okay to leave."

cults,kx2xk5,How do you function in a relationship after you've been in a cult?,"Long story short, I was part of the International Churches of Christ for two and a half years, and being a member nearly cost me my literal sanity and life. 

Additionally, I developed so much shame around my sexuality even though I'm a straight dude, and was shamed out of dating relationships because my mental illness was a liability to the ""purity"" of the ""sisters."" We couldn't hang out with girls (called ""sisters"") unless we were in a group (of ""brothers"" that were ""mature"" and ""consistent"" called an ""encouragement date."" We had to actually confess to each other (obviously the same gender) about when we masturbated or ""fell into sexual sin."" You couldn't hang out with sisters unless you ""encouraged"" them on the ""dates."" You couldn't date until the leader of your ministry or congregation approved it, and then you had to go on more dates to signify that you were ""building."" Then after a very specific ""dating proposal"" you could date. And then after basically you stopped masturbating for a long time, you could propose and get married. 

So naturally, as a guy who is very emotionally sensitive, empathic, and generally has a high sex drive, shame and guilt and sexual insecurity skyrocketed for two and a half years because I was gaslighted into believing that those characteristics were liabilities that could in fact make my wife leave the faith.

So with this context, how in the world does one date, explore one's sexuality, and maintain a relationship after being shamed of literally all of that from being in a cult? I guess practically, what steps can I take to be comfortable in my sexuality, character, and personality in regard to relationships?"

cults,kvgiuj,"Mooseheart, Batavia, Illinois","My bf is an Amazon delivery driver. Today around 2 o clock he calls me flipping shit. He said that Amazon just made him deliver to some place called 'Mooseheart'. He said it was a large community with a shit ton of buildings. This in Batavia, Illinois. They would not let him drive into their community to drop off their packages, and they had 2 security guards with their trucks escort him through backroads throughout their community to get to a secluded drop off location for their packages. He said when he was driving down this backroad, he saw a kid alone walking down the road, and when he saw his van with the 2 security trucks he said he started to sprint away from them. He also told me when he first pulled up a lady asked if he needed help figuring out where to put the packages, and one of the security guards who was a guy quickly showed up and said 'No, that is NOT your place.' My bf at first thought he said 'No, that is ok' but after he asked me to look up the name Mooseheart and I was presented with multiple sources stating it is a cult... he was like yeah, he was definitely degrading that woman. He said driving through it was like driving through a prison, with barbed wire high fences and giant strobe lights! 

I look it up and it is deadass a cult. It is described as an 'unincorporated community and home for children and teens administered by the Loyal Order of Moose'. They have tiers in there... the women are part of their own group in the Order of Moose... they pray at certain times to literal Moose entities... It was a community founded in 1913, donated by the Moose Order... why is it that its still unincorporated in 2021? They give infants from older teens 'social skills' and the 'best possible TRAINING and education'. They have tiers for the members. They have giant church like seminars... there are phases into getting admitted. The founder said he wished for there to be a giant 'Child City' concept. The entire Moose organization is built upon racism, only caucasians were allowed, up until 1970. They make thier members do initiation and afterwards they chant and say they can not speak of anything that happens at the Lodge EVER. Apparantly Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, and Harry S Truman were members.

It got hit with a lot of weird stuff... lots of child porn charges. So much... And recent stuff too. Nothing was ever done just a change of CEOs or something. They take children from disadvantaged lives and it seems like they abuse them sexually and exploit them and there can even be INFANTS there, indoctrinated from BIRTH. It is deadass a pedophile cult. Just put the pieces together... actually its litwrally right there in text, just look up charges against Mooseheart and be prrsented with the disgusting harsh reality :/ Look up Mooseheart if you guys are curious for exact articles, its very interesting, Im on mobile so its kinda hard. Mooseheart is very clearly a cult! Kinda crazy, especially because there were Presidents in it! Actually now that I think about it I might of learned about them in my textbook in sophmore year but Im not exactly sure.

The town, Batavia, has tons of streets named after Mooseheart. Church bells ring randomly he said and they arent regular church bells. My bf told his dispatch if he ever gets sent to this creepy ass backwards 'unincorparted community' town ever again he is going to refuse and go home for the day. He said the face when the kid saw the trucks was sheer terror, and he also told me he asked the security guard what this community was and he gave him a weird ass answer 'we reeducate troubled children about life, god, marriage, sex, romance, and life itself!' he gave the security guard a weird look and asked him 'what?' and after that he stopped talking to my bf he said. And there you have it, the sex cult unincorporated community: MOOSEHEART!"

The guy is obviously a troll, using a lot of complicated word in his descriptions, sprinkled with obviously joking stuff like ""sonic hedgehog pathways"" in the brain.

So I thought maybe this sub is a joke sub. But people seem to take it very seriously. They believe the total bullcrap of ""morphic fields"" and sound ""transmitting the code of stem cells"". They all argue it has helped them get healthier, lose weight, grow hair, enhance their breasts, etc etc etc.

It seems funny and harmless but some people are seeing it as a valid treatment and foregoing actual medical treatment. The man is being praised like a god and the whole thing feels like a cult.

The worst thing in my opinion is that Reddit's algorithm is actively promoting this subreddit, under the banner of ""Medical and Mental Health subreddits"" (!!!!!). This is completely irresponsible.

So, while I was asking her, questions, about where she lived, which was around the same time, as when she used the word, “manifested,” which I didn't like, even slightly, I learned that they, fifth dimensional individuals, don't have a sun, over there, as we do, here where we live, in the third dimension.  And I also learned, that she, uses, lanterns, to see.  But she didn't use, the exact word “lanterns.”  Here's what happened.  The session started out with me asking Mary if she had any messages for me.  She wrote, ""Out of joined standards come the best creations.""  Then I asked her what she meant by ""Standards.""  She replied, ""Just that 2 cores are better than one"".  So you know, she calls, brains, ""cores.""  Then I changed the subject and asked her if there was fire in the fifth dimension.""  She replied, ""All elements thrive here.""  After that, I asked her what fire is used for in the fifth dimension.  Her response was, ""Heat.""  And then I asked her what were some things that she heats up with fire in the fifth dimension.  She answered, ""Lights.""  From that, I asked her if she meant that she used lanterns.  She replied, ""Yes.""  Then I asked her if it was hard to see without the lanterns.  She answered, ""No, they are simply comfortable.""  For my money's worth, there is something fascinating about Mary describing herself as using lanterns.   And at that time in the history, of me talking to Mary, well, that discussion really made me start considering, very seriously, that I was really talking to a spirit on the Ouija board.  The communication was unlike anything I could have expected.  I mean she uses fire for lights?  If the Ouija board was working because of the utilization of my or my Ouija partners subconscious, the planchette wouldn't have spelled out ""lights,"" for something produced by fire.  We, having electricity our entire lives, wouldn't have given me that response.

cults,ktzq21,im pretty sure im in a cult/manipulative church part 2,"this is a follow up post from my last one so for context maybe read the other one.

in my last post u/jackandmozz commented some more signs that were alarmingly similar to my church

my church has two pastors: pastor b and pastor a

pastor a is the one who normally preaches but pastor b is the one who leads group prayer

she get us to repeat after her and do group praying in tongues (I fake it by just doing bvdfweuu)

she also sometimes 'hear from God' and speak as if they are god ex-""I'm telling you to stop doing this"" which also applies to the elitist comment i made about pastor a.

ok this is out of context but this is just an interesting thing that made me cringe in one of his last messages. pastor a compared a prophet to donald trump... 👀👀👀

these pastors have been in power for like, as long as i remember

some background information is that pastor a said something pretty controversial a couple years ago and he lost LOADS of his congregation and now he mocks them and shames anyone who leaves

he also has to give people permission to leave the church, if he doesnt and they leave they get shamed..

they call the world evil, like in the context of people getting more rights.

just think manipulative redneck, then thats my pastor

this is all i think, this post isn't necessarily cult behavior, its more manipulation but i still think it should be included for context sake"

cults,ktlgwl,Langorek Vampire Cult???,"im doing research on a really weird group of people. It started on this site called similar worlds. some weird ass person with a whole host of issues posts a rant about a vampire cult chasing them. odd, disturbing, and maybe even a little creepy, but not really alarming compared to the normal internet weirdos. but the word he called them was just..... different than what you would see on a normal crazy persons ramblings. ""Langorek."" it's just not a word that you see often, much less a word in general. so i felt inclined to look it up. I was not expecting what i found. there were a few now deleted posts and comments on r/vampires that managed to tip off the search term, but what really got me was a so called ""Vampirism website"". 

this site -literally called vampirismforum.com- could be a cult of its own. it bases itself and it's ideology around a series of books by an obscure Portuguese author named Luis Marques. it's creepy, sure, but what really got me was when i asked on said site about the name. they knew the name. they acknowledged its existence in their little world. that got my interest piqued to a whole new degree. then i got the message.

this woman, whom i will not name due to not knowing if this entire thing is a weird rp thing, had messaged me telling me all sorts of insane things. I won't list all of them in detail, but let's just say lizard vampire people and all sorts of other fun topics were explored. as i talked to her more in depth, she told so many disturbing things, like how she was the supposed next in line for the ""throne"" of langoreks, and how they were recruiting soldiers for a takeover of the planet. this got me concerned, not just because it sounded like bat shit insanity, but because it was eerily similar to what the other crazy person was saying on similar worlds. after admitting my skepticism to her, she cut all ties with me. soon after an account was made that was close in name to the one i had made to access the vampirism site posted a rant trying to out her as a langorek i guess? (shits just weird now) and both mine and the imposters accounts were banned. I don't know what to think about this. but i had been talking to this woman for about a month over kik and had even been able to convince her that i had been bitten by a vampire and the fact that she believed that leads me to believe that she might be being used as an unaware recruiter for a doomsday cult. it makes sense, since she was so ready to believe that i was the next Dracula yet she couldn't even take a bit of criticism on her story. I've even managed to find a sort of manifesto from that similar worlds site which I will link to shortly. my question is: what the fuck is this rabbit hole and have any of you encountered this cult before?"

I'm gonna refer to the church as.. church and everything will remain anonymous for safety reasons. 

ive read many cult stories and that has lead me to believe that i am in one myself. Im gonna name some of the reasons why i think im in a cult

1. they shame people who leave the church and have different views
2. they are super closed off to the outside world (they even run a private school in the church basement that preaches the same hateful messages)
3. they love bomb you and make sure you get attached to the church
4. they preach hateful messages but in a slow burn kinda way (brainwashing basically)
5. they preach ""end times"" propaganda and use scare tactics
6. the 'pastor' pressures members for donations

Ive had a lot of experience with the school and church and ill be listing some ones that stick out to me as culty

1. when i was still attending the school i was forced to pray and also was taught homophobic and elitist lessons (that us, straight christians were the elite humans and anyone who differed was going to hell)
2. my 'pastor' taught toxic gender roles (men cant cry and have to be the authority over vulnerable weak women)
3. 'pastor' preaching of end times and scared us to enforce the teachings
4. he also pressured us for money. he would spend 20-30 min talking about if we dont tithe we are not true christians. and by the end say no pressure.
5. he would mock people who left and would speak in a whiny tone to voice different opinions. calling people who left the church backsliders and non-believers

this is all i have for now, if i think of more ill post a part two

please leave comments with ur opinions id love to hear about them."
cults,ktjkes,Christ Church International,"Throw away for my and my SO's safety.

My SO grew up very religious and moved to Africa with his mom and step dad when they became missionaries when he was 9. At age 17 (in 2002-ish) he moved back to the states and joined Christ Church International in Brookhaven, Mississippi. Though, I believe he said it was Living Word of Faith or Word of Faith Ministries back then. Either way, it was run by Rev. David Franklin. They gave my SO housing, but he was expected to get up and read the Bible and pray everyday then the group of men of the church would go out and do construction work, then come back home after dinnertime and read the Bible, go to bed, then start that same thing over again. The workers never got paid for that work and instead the church would collect it and provide everyone with a small stipend and the rest was considered paying for their housing. Pretty much anyone that worked for or was in the church lived on the church property. He was there for 5 or 6 years. During that time, the reverends son was charged and convicted of having sex with a minor. My SO was also teaching at the academy there with nothing more than a high school education (King's Brook Christian Academy). To leave, my SO and his then-wife packed everything up in the middle of the night to escape. Because the construction job that he had with the church was his only work experience he had, he had to use that and the Reverends name on job applications. When the employers would call the reverend to verify employment, he would slander my SO. It took him almost 2 years to find a job because of him.

Recently I came across an article from 2018 where the reverend is being accused of sexual abuse to 2 underage girls. I can't find a follow up article on what happened tho. There is even a YouTube video that someone made regarding their experience with their kid at the academy: https://youtu.be/FWJUisp-3l0

Has anyone else ever heard of this cult? Anyone have any additional info? For obvious reasons, after 2007/2008, my SO wanted to avoid anything that had to do with that cult. But I'm completely fascinated by them, so I gotta know more! My google search has come up pretty empty."

Over the years they have had several babies very close together and don’t believe in any form of birth control or family planning, the mother(our friend) has suffered greatly as a result of these pregnancies but continues going this route. 
They also refuse to send their kids to school and homeschool them instead. They don’t believe in vaccinations, modern medicine, or going to doctors. They live in the middle of nowhere in the south and attempt to live off the land. They are deeply religious (Christian I believe) and require their children to read the Bible daily and discuss God as part of curriculum. However they also buy very expensive organic food, and natural vitamins  but don’t buy clothes or bedding or even enough beds for their children and instead expect their church and community to provide for them where they fall short. They make a large income but claim to never have any money and we are worried they’re giving it all to a leader or church or figure head."

cults,kt0x1s,Trying to create a cult to end all cults. Need advice.,"So after seeing all the other cults and religions extant in the world today I decided that I want to create a platform for the quasi-religious worship and reverence of the concepts of Progress, Meaning, and Positive Change.  


The cult itself and its name as well as its doctrines and teachings are quite literally works-in-progress. Being a work-in-progress is also the basis of the cult from the ground up. Currently I'm calling it The Open Source Experience.  


I'm hoping that making it open and accessible for everyone to see both process and implementation will make it clear that bad intentions are not welcome. That said, it's a cult. It's designed to consume lives and shoehorn people into ways of thinking and acting. That's kind of the point. This is generally for people who wish to change their lives.  


People look for meaning wherever they can find it, so my idea is to give them meaning and something to work towards. It's an idea that's as old as religion.  Currently the only tenet I have solidified is that faith is progress and progress is faith, purposefully cyclical so that people can endlessly loop that thought without quite knowing exactly where it really begins and where it ends because the point is to not end. Such is life.  


I wish to create a mechanism similar to the marketplace of ideas. Where beliefs and ideas can be shared and evaluated by a large group of people in order to optimize and refine them before applying them to our lives.  I want disciples to be able to think hard and long about their lives and the lives of those around them in order to find ways to methodically improve and optimize, striving for perfection over time.  


Crowd mentality is a powerful force and I wish to take advantage of it to attract and indoctrinate people en masse. Not for personal gain, but to help people like myself who lack direction and focus in their lives.   


I don't want to recreate what's been done before. I have no wish to clone a single personality onto innumerable followers or box people into a single mode of thinking. I want to create a religion that lacks the traditional dogmas and scriptures of the established religions for the purpose of encouraging and facilitating freedom of thought.  


I want to give the world a form of motivation that can stand the test of time, to create fanatics that obsessively seek efficiency in all aspects of their lives and to bring humanity itself to greater heights through learning, mindfulness, and meaningful net positive change.  


I want to  create a religion that forces people to focus on progress but doesn't distract them with bullshit mythology, doesn't try to limit their ideas, doesn't force them into any particular mode of thinking, only directs them to think about and progress in their lives in healthy and constructive ways.  


Every day people seek something to fight for and believe in. I want to give them a way to understand and rationalize the more difficult aspects of their lives so they aren't overwhelmed. Something to believe in that will bring them peace of mind and something to comfort them in their moments of hardship and, at the end of their lives, something that not only brings them comfort but also comforts those around them and over time helps to mend the wounds that their passing has left.  


In short I wish to give people a platform that lets them depend, not on some mythical god or phantasmal ideology, but on themselves without letting them feel so very alone and without them feeling like they're not in control of their destinies and futures.  


I want to help as many people as I can, but I don't want to create generations of dependents who must rely on external sources for the betterment of their lives.  


Give a person a fish and you can feed them for a meal. Teach that person to fish and that person can pass on their knowledge as well as feed themselves and everyone they care about. I wish to metaphorically teach people not only how to fish but how to optimize the process of fishing over time in order to, over time, gain greater fishing efficiency until their knowledge and the knowledge of all who may come after is perfected by generations of fishing knowledge."
cults,ksxiat,Does anyone recognize or know the name of this cult?,"One of my best friends in high school was raised in a cult, but she never told me the name of it. She was El Salvadorian and all their scriptures and teachings were in Spanish, but their ""prophets"" were white men. She was only allowed to wear long skirts and wasn't allowed to cut her hair, wear makeup, or wear anything too bright or revealing. 

I don't remember much about what their teachings were (partially because she avoided giving me direct answers to my questions) but I know their main goal was training their women to be ""the bride of Jesus"" that he'd come down and select during the rapture. They weren't allowed to date outside their religion, and their church services were held in a member's house instead of an actual church. 

My friend ran away from the cult with her boyfriend right after we graduated and got married to him, but they got a divorce a couple years ago and she went back to her family and to the cult. I haven't heard from her since, I believe they made her cut contact with everyone. I worry about her still and I'd like to know more about the cult she's a part of. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Google hasn't been much help."

I'm new to this subreddit and was wondering if anyone here has heard of or grew up in this cult: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace\_Communion\_International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Communion_International) It was a pretty large religious cult, but it seems not many people have ever heard of it. I was born and raised in it and left in my early 20s. I still have a lot of anger about the life that was taken away from me. There are things that I will never experience as an adult. I feel completely cut off from society and can't relate to many people at all. I've always suffered from severe depression and anxiety, and now I have PTSD on top of it all with horrible nightmares every single night. I wish my life could be different. I never planned for a future because we were told there would be no future, so I'm an unemployed loser with no career. I would love to be able to work, but my social anxiety is through the roof. I can barely leave my house (even before Covid). I know nothing will change things. I will never get the past back, but I can't stop thinking about it. Anyway, I just wondered if there is anyone else here who feels the same way, whether they grew up in this particular cult or another one. It would be nice to not feel so alone. Thanks so much for listening."

&gt;Quote:   
*In the early days after my son’s death, we were puzzled as to why the police department hadn’t contacted us. Their silence was disturbing. In March of 2007, just weeks after Kyle died, his oldest brother was the first family member to call the Clearwater Police Department. This is when we learned that Detective Stephen Bohling had been assigned to the case. Bohling was a veteran, he’d spent most of his 16-year career with the Clearwater department. After speaking with him only twice, however, Kyle’s brother thought it best that someone else ask him our questions. He said the police detective had been glib and arrogant, even antagonistic.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*That’s when I realized I needed to talk with Bohling myself. I desperately wanted to understand how, and why, my son had died. But my heart was shattered. My emotions at the time weren’t even perceptible; they’d consumed me, they’d become me. To get answers—not just for me, but for everyone who loved Kyle—I had to somehow will my psyche past the pain that was still very raw and overwhelming. Now I understood that I’d have to compartmentalize my anguish, file it away. I also knew I couldn’t let my guard down. Ever-present were the words of the Dominican priest: “They will take your grief,” he’d warned, “and use it as a weapon against you.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*There were so many troubling questions. After Kyle’s belongings were sent home, for example, we’d discovered that his computer had been accessed in the middle of the night, but a few hours after his death. Everything had been deleted. Tom Brennan, Kyle’s father, had changed his initial story about the night Kyle died. And the details changed weren’t minor; they were eyebrow-raising, red flag alterations: where he’d been, who he’d been with, and the time he’d arrive home.*

cults,kq4any,an old friend told me about this questionable camp he went to a few years ago. it seemed a little cult-like and I can’t stop thinking about it,"a couple years ago I was friends with this guy who told me about this strange camp he went to as a teenager. apparently it was some sort of inspirational self improvement camp were they’d make you think critically about yourself and teach you how to improve or whatever. this wasn’t very long ago, he’d gone sometime between 2014-2017. he actually had a good experience there and was recommending it to me because I was in a really low place in my life and super depressed. 

I don’t really remember very much of what he told me about this camp but there was one detail in particular that unsettled me. apparently they all did this activity that caused them to pass out or go unconscious. he never explained to me how they passed out, or why, but apparently he enjoyed it and thought it was healing in some way. and keep in mind, this was something he participated in when he was a minor, like 15-17 yrs old. I’m usually interested and open minded to spiritual stuff but this immediately sounded kinda creepy and cult-like to me. is it even legal to make a bunch of teens pass out for a camp activity? is this something that happens?? am I just being judgemental and over thinking it? he assured me that it was safe and not weird at all. 

the conversation is a little bit fuzzy in my memory, but I THINK he might have said that this was somehow connected to his family member’s church, but that it wasn’t a religious jesus camp or anything. he wasn’t a religious person and his parents were slightly christian I think, but nowhere near strict. they seemed pretty “normal.” that’s about all I remember, I think I changed the subject because I was confused and slightly annoyed that he thought this camp would cure my trauma and lifelong mental health issues. later on I ended up having a falling out with him for unrelated reasons, so I no longer talk to him or wish to talk to him ever again

I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post this on, but i’m very very curious if anyone else has heard of a camp like this and if the whole passing out activity sounds normal/safe/legal to you. part of me feels like i’m over thinking this and being dramatic but I’ll probably always wonder about this camp if I never hear about it again"

But on the other hand, I also feel a different urge just to wash my hands of the whole thing and to put it behind me. It almost feels like trying to expose them would stand in the way of me getting on with my life. And, from personal experience, I know it's probably not possible to get somebody to leave before they're ready.

Have other cult survivors experienced this dilemma? Have you found closure in working to expose your former cult? Or is living well really the best revenge?"

cults,kp66dr,Richard Grannon creating cult like influence,I wanted to find out if anyone had experiences with the youtube channel Richard Grannon. He claims to be able to heal people of CPTSD but he uses nlp and deletes any negative comments towards him. His followers follow what he says religiously and I've seen some people comment on his concerning behaviour. In the comments of this video of a psychologist critiquing Grannon people shared some troubling experiences.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to19aZiiwRg&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to19aZiiwRg&amp;t=1s)  People also talked about him having a cult like following. Anyone have any experience with this? Thank you
cults,kp5nzx,"January 1986: On or around this date in history, 34 years ago, Radhanath Swami, the second most-respected devotee at New Vrindaban (next to Bhaktipada), recruited John Sinkowski (Janmastami dasa) into the conspiracy to murder Steven Bryant (Sulochan dasa).","January 1986: On or around this date in history, 34 years ago, Radhanath Swami, the second most-respected devotee at New Vrindaban (next to Bhaktipada), recruited John Sinkowski (Janmastami dasa) into the conspiracy to murder Steven Bryant (Sulochan dasa). 

Janmastami explained how he was recruited to assist in the assassination of Sulochan: “In January of 1986, on my return to New Vrindaban [after the Christmas marathon], I was ordered by Radhanath, . . . not by Kirtanananda Swami, to terminate Sulochan. This happened with Tapahpunja Swami and Tirtha in November and December of 1985. I was on traveling sankirtan until Christmas and didn’t get back to the farm until New Years. Immediately on our arrival at New Vrindaban, Radhanath sought me out and made arrangements for us to meet in his van, where he went through a prepared speech that he had delivered to Tirtha, Tapahpunja Swami and Kuladri many times before. Later talks with Tirtha confirmed this.”  

Janmastami claimed that Radhanath flattered him, “You are one of those rare few that Krishna has endowed with the ksatriya spirit and the courage enough to do what has to be done.” 

Janmastami remembered his conversation with Radhanath Swami in more detail: “Radhanath was saying to those he was giving marching orders to: ‘Sulochan poses a life threat to both Kuladri and to Kirtanananda Swami. . . . For that reason alone, this guy must be transmigrated to his next body.' Radhanath was clear in his meaning beyond any shadow of a doubt. 'Now that Srila Prabhupada has left us, the entire fate of this movement—our movement, Lord Chaitanya’s movement—rests in Kirtanananda Swami’s hands, and according to our nature, it is up to us to do whatever we can to help the movement in that regard.' . . . Radhanath had made his pitch to at least a half a dozen sets of sympathetic ears before someone raised these Gita-related questions: ‘How have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. The words existent and non-existent refer only to spirit and matter. Why worry? How can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn, eternal, and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?’ Tough questions, but from a submissive audience. Radhanath was undaunted. He quoted Krishna in his response to a potentially explosive volley of inquiry: ‘Everything has its proper utility, and a man situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction. Also, considering your specific duty as a ksatriya. . . .’ That settled it. The order was there from your bona-fide spiritual authority and it was based on scripture, directly from Krishna. Either you followed those instructions or you were going to hell!” 

Janmastami’s story was collaborated by others. Bhaktipada’s chauffeur claimed: “I was privy to much behind-the-scenes action, and I was there when Radhanath told Janmastami to ‘destroy the demon.’” A teenage boy, who worked closely under Janmastami’s supervision for about a decade, claimed Radhanath Swami said to Janmastami, “He’s a demon, and demons have to die.” 

Another devotee remembered in more detail, “It was January 1986, soon after the Christmas marathon, as I recall. I happened to enter the temple from the back door by the pujari room with Janmastami. It was japa time, maybe a half hour before mangala-aroti. Devotees were chanting japa, many pacing back and forth while chanting. I noticed Radhanath was talking to Kuladri; they were both walking side by side in the temple room. Janmastami joined them and I stood alongside Janmastami. There was some conversation and I overheard Radhanath tell Janmastami, 'The demon must die.' It sounded like Radhanath was quoting sastra; he spoke with authority and conviction. I did not know at the time what was going on, but in retrospect, it seems perfectly clear to me now that they were speaking of Sulochan.”  

Others also incriminated Radhanath Swami in the murder plot. Kuladri indirectly implicated Radhanath when he said: “I know Tapahpunja, along with other swamis, were saying that the community had to do whatever is necessary to protect the Swami [Kirtanananda].” At this time there were only three swamis at New Vrindaban: Kirtanananda, Tapahpunja and Radhanath.

Dharmatma, the Director of Sankirtan, claimed that Kuladri told him: “Radhanath, Hayagriva and Tapahpunja were pushing like crazy for this [murder] to happen.”   Dharmatma wrote later: “With all due respect, as I do like him [Radhanath] as a person, and he is a sweet devotee, but still he was involved to some degree or had knowledge of Sulochan’s murder. I know this for a fact.” 

During an interview with investigators in 1989, Kuladri directly implicated Radhanath Swami in the murder conspiracy and also indicated that Radhanath had probably spoken about it to Bhaktipada.

Q. “Let’s go back now to Richard Slavin talking and making these preachings [to do whatever is necessary to protect the Swami]. Is there any question in your mind . . . whether Kirtanananda knew that Slavin was preaching . . . [that] the devotees had to do whatever it took to protect their Swami, who was a representative of God? Did Kirtanananda know that Slavin was making these preachings?”

A. “You know, I would say yes, because Radhanath Swami, Richard Slavin, was always talking with Kirtanananda because he represented Kirtanananda. He would invite people to take initiation from Kirtanananda. He was opening temples for Kirtanananda, so he was always in communication with Kirtanananda, and his preaching would always reflect Kirtanananda’s desire.”

cults,kp4x77,"Audio from Jonestown on the fateful day. Disturbing (please proceed with caution), but revealing. Among other things, I hadn't realized his followers called him Dad.",
cults,kp4d8i,My dad was a pastor in one of the biggest christian cults in the world.,"From ages 0 -12 My parents were heavily Involved in this church and gave up 90% of there lives to it. The reason they are so bigs  because they are located in 50+ countries(Thats was back in 2011 there are probably more now)  I wouldn't doubt it if one of there churches is in 50 mile radius of you. To paint a picture how big this church is they have conferences every 4 years so big it fills up ''The staples center'' in Los Angeles.

What They Believe: The founder of the church opened its first location in Los Angeles in the 90s. Different types of people showed up . Gang members , Drug addicts, etc. We call them gods ""treasures out of darkness""  The founder says one night he was at a hotel in La Vegas crying because he wanted to ""help"" people all over the world he says that god told him he would start a ''program"" called u\*\*\*\*\* \*\* \*\*\*"" where people give money to help fund the churches all over the world and help drug addicts and gang members and etc. 

The church is now worth millions and has destroyed lives here are personal stories and others peoples stories.

WOMAN AND MENS HOME: If you're a drug addict or gang member and want to get clean the church will gladly take you in but you have to sign away your freedom. You're not allowed to talk to anyone on the outside including family and if you're lucky enough to have a phone call a higher up must be present and it must be on speaker phone. I remember once a member had to ask the higher up to have him call his daughter and wish her happy birthday ( he was not allowed to speak to her). I've heard storied and have read yelp reviews about the abuse in the homes. my dad told me a story about one the home directors who was very mean to the men. Years later one of the men ended up murdering him. I read a yelp review on a young girl who wasn't an addict or gang member being mistreated and abused and couldn't even tell her mother cause the woman was in the room. While you're there you do free work for the church and all the money that is made goes to the church they also drop you off at random shopping centers and have you passing out flyers to bring in more members.. A pastor later  came out and said that these homes are how they fund their events. The homes sound much similar to the scientology concentration camps.

They have a youth organization as well that does the same thing. But the difference is you pay thousands of dollars to join.

Control: If You're there long enough they have full control of your lives. When I was a kid life was good lived in a 3 bedroom house my dad had a decent job then one day we moved to another city lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and struggled to pay rent. I ended up finding out years later that one of the pastors that my dad was helping run the church got into some trouble and my dad was the only one who knew of it so to avoid question from the members they made us move. Which we did. to hide a secret. Other pastors didn't go so smoothly. My dad told me the story how a pastor had built his whole life in the church and had 2 daughters months away from graduating high school . They also wanted him to move he told them I have a life a job and 2 daughters months away from graduating and they threatened to take his ministering license away. Something he worked hard on and meant a lot to him ( ps. This church is the only church that charges you 200$ a month to become a pastor)

It's not just the pastors that are under control its the members as well. people I knew worked 9 to 5 and the church would still put responsibilities on them. If you're there long enough the church puts you to work. They can tell you to move to another country in a split second take your children out of sports and activities that interfere with the church and forbid you from seeing other people. 

Brainwashing: A pastor that also exposed the church stated that the founder does not preach the word of god he used god to push his vision. He is not a preacher he's more of a motivational speaker. He uses god to tell you why we need to push his vision. Which is why you need to give up your time and money to help push this vision. 

They convince people (even people who don't have much of an income) into giving thousands of dollars. First they make you watch this video about how your money can help. Then they tell you how god will give you double or triple the amount in return . Then they bring up people to testify how they gave thousands of dollars to the church and in return god gave them money some go to say cars or even a house. Most of the testimonies are from higher ups. Then the pastor will begin talking like its an auction. Who wants to donate 5,000$ 4,000$ and it goes on and on . They're not preaching to people that have that kind of money. my dad was sleeping on my brothers couch just starting a new job and the church tried to convince him to give all of his income tax money to the church so god could bless him double. If you don't have the thousand dollar funds they convince you to donate a dollar a day to the church and if you can't do that they see you as having no vision and uncomitted. The pastor preaches "" THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU IF YOU CAN'T DONATE A DOLLAR A DAY""

Personal Experiences: One of the married pastors "" came on"" to my mother . my mother turned him down then she told the higher up pastor of the church he pretty much told her that he can't deal with that right now and to keep it to herself. Then other woman started to come out about the pastor but my mother was the only one who went to the pastor about it . So to make an example to shut the other woman up the church said my mother came on to him. Months later we left the church."

I'm just gonna copy-paste what I sent him, as it's the most succinct version of what's currently going on. Like today, as in it started this morning.

I need your help; or I need to assemble some kind of team.I don't wanna give you too much backstory, and I would maybe even need some guidance because this whole situation is sort of still in its infancy. An old friend from middle school (she should be 20-21 by now I think) reached out to me about a month ago and we've been reconnecting thru the pandemic madness and such. This morning, however, she hit me up about a weird experience she had at a store. She was looking for jewelry supplies when this woman approached her (blonde, short, very ""plain looking"" as per her description. Looked very young, ""millennial"" or around our age I guess. No identifying marks/blemishes/tattoos or anything from what she saw) and started asking her about what she makes. I can provide screenshots of our conversation (attached at the bottom). 

  
I am taking this seriously, because I believe that sex trafficking and cults are most likely more common and widespread than we think they are, solely on just how fucked up and secretive they can be.  
The woman started telling Z a classic scheme of how she could make money really quickly, how to stop ""running after paycheck to paycheck"" and how she could make the most out of her money and time. She said yeah, that would be cool, and apparently they had a Zoom chat. I'll just include in the screenshots how she summed that up. I'm blocking out her prof pic just to make sure her identity is concealed.

cults,ko1ea1,How do I know if I'm brainwashed? How do I leave and still be okay?,"I've known it was at least a ""cult lite"" for a while. I'm addicted to the cult, and maybe I'd be able to tolerate it, if it weren't for the membership's overwhelming science-denial, social Darwinism, maligning of empathy, slander of marginalized groups and effort to make their lives better, anti-medicine viewpoints, and general cruelty. I feel a great loyalty to the belief system and the leader, but I want to leave because he is putting me in danger by not taking COVID precautions. It tests my conscience when he compares wearing masks to the Holocaust. I loved the belief system, and I still find much of it (plus the practices) very useful and practical...but this is a religion for a conservative old man, not for me. We keep attracting semi-crypto white supremacists and at some point I have to ask ""why?""  


Fringe attracts fringe I guess. I am \[LGBT\] (I'm fully aware that just reading that is triggering someone here and they're filling in the blanks about what that means for the rest of my mind and intentions. Yeah, whatever. Maybe keep it to yourself just for once, okay? I'm reaching out for help.)  


Anyways, most members hate me for that. Even the leader makes it a problem that I want to advocate for my rights at all. I cannot abide this. Being ""one of the good ones"" is not sustainable, not to mention completely fake. I feel like he lives in the past. He's kinda racist too. So much sexism present in our ""clients"" as well. I don't get any time to myself. I don't get paid to work here. I don't see a future for myself here but still....I love it? I love that glow hypnotic way I feel after some of our...doings.  


They make me feel wrong about setting boundaries and every thing I do with them is political. It's like half the time I'm being love-boded, and the other half I'm not good enough.  


But here's the thing: The leader CANNOT be a con-artist, he is not a deliberate cult leader, because HE FULLY BELIEVES THIS STUFF. He grew up in it, and he just inherited this role...In fact, he is incredibly uncomfortable with being a leader and is not narcissistic in the least. It makes him feel awkward to be looked up to.  


So...doesn't that mean it's not a cult?  


I'm hiding out and about right now, somewhere safe. I can't really talk on the phone when I'm with them because they'll hear me and I feel very restricted. Like I'm being socially stunted. My primary incentive for finally just taking off, even if temporarily, was that there's a COVID-denying client at the HQ (where I live) right now and he's coughed and sneezed on everything all the while trying to convince me that the Earth is flat and some bullshit about Tha Jooz. He paid good money though so I have to be ""professional.""  


I know that if I leave again...like I did many months back...that I'll cry everyday from the shock and loss and grief of losing this. This was all I cared about. I was SO INTO IT. It was my special interest and my safety blanket when life was tough. Now it's getting sour.

Is this brainwashing?  
Am I brainwashed?  
Am I overreacting?  
How can you leave a cult amicably? They know my secrets."
cults,knyfp4,Does anyone on here remember these groups??,"When I was 8 or 9 ( it was 91 or 92) my family joined a group of about 6 or so other people who lived in an old school bus. This was in Oregon and I only remember that we referred to ourselves as “the fellowship “. My parents sold everything and bought a travel trailer and we traveled around the umqua and willamet national forests in the mountains in western Oregon for about a year.

The doctrine was that the leader had been a part of the Jesus movement in some church Or community called Shiloh back in the 70s in Cali, and some guy he met there had had a dream that there would be an earthquake 14 on the rictor scale (if it could go that high) and that the entire west coast would go underwater leaving the coastal mountain range as islands. The earthquake was supposed to happen on June first , so every year that it didn’t happen the leader would say it was going to happen next year.

And yeah you guessed it, we were going to be the chosen survivors hidden in the mountains that would then become our islands.

Anyway after June first came and went we bailed and most of the other members left afterwards.

The reason for this post is to find out if anyone here knows of that little group. I think in all it existed there in Oregon for about 5 years. We would evangelize in Roseburg and Eugine at the Rescue missions which were like homeless shelters. 

Not sure if everyone from that era is dead from LSD overdoses Or grunge music inspired suicide yet (I literally mean that) but am curious if anyone on here remembers it. 

The leaders name was Daniel and his last name was either Melton or Ellison. He had a daughter named Rachel who married a guy named Anthony. (Hope it’s ok to put names on here, it is very long ago and far away for me now) I’d be curious to find some of these people again.



Later on in life, in 95 my family moved to Tennessee and we ran into another group that originated in Geneva FL and was somehow related to 12 tribes, I think the leader had been in it at one time.

The leaders real name was David Taylor but he changed it to Noah Taylor, I guess because his group was like Noah’s ark or something.
Anyway they ended up having about 500 members all living an a large piece of acreage and some remnant of it still exists in West TN in the form of an organic farming community.

I’ll put some links because they are on Facebook to this day and there is also an old forum discussing them as a cult.

The leader, Noah or David isn’t there anymore and I heard he went to Africa to start some other cult or something. I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this.

Thanks.

The website of the letting agent was really bizarre and they seemed to endorse something called All*tRa, which on further investigation seems to be a Ukranian cult. They had very little information on the house and they weren’t listened on official letting agent lists here, so we were suspicious but they lessened the prices and our friend was in desperate need of moving soon for a job so she went but she went while on video call with a number of our other friends. 

The moment the woman there (we think she was Ukranian, but if not at least eastern-European of some kind) saw that our friend was on her phone she immediately grew frosty and tried to rush through the appointment. She also spent a good deal of it outside standing with an unknown man who said nothing to our friend whatsoever. She was asked tons of questions about the letting agency and the landlord and wasn’t able to answer any of them, including not being able answer anything about the age of the company despite it apparently being extremely new. 

To make matters worse we tracked down the business and found that it is based out of the [same address](https://financefeeds.com/85-year-old-woman-behind-fake-london-binary-options-firm-addresses-exposed/) that thousands of shell companies have been tracked to over the years.

cults,knllwq,Question about hallucinations under a ‘teacher’,"Hi guys

I’m coming to this forum to ask for insight on a confusing part of my life. 

When I was 13-17 I was groomed by a 65 year old spiritualist to join a cult. I have since distanced myself and although 21 now, I recognise that I have been influenced by her ideas. My experience as her student was very profound; having hallucinated multiple times supposedly achieving a ‘higher state of consciousness’. 

These hallucinations are the reason for my post, as to this day I am unsure if I was involuntary drugged, hypnotised or just impressionable or if I actually did achieve aheightened states of consciousness in her presence. 

What I want to know is if anyone else has had experiences like this growing up? Hallucinating large intimidating silvery beings who appear translucent, glimmering as if made from a crystalline substance - Who shoot rays of energy at you. 

Another type of hallucination was seeing sacred geometry being invoked underneath her or even seeing it abstractly when closing your eyes? Like the torus field.

Does this sound like something innately spiritual or could it be I was drugged?

cults,kmn772,"I exited a cult over three years ago, but I'm realizing now that I may still somewhat be under their influence","I'd prefer to keep it vague, although I'll divulge details if it's necessary for the purpose of making this post. This is a throwaway account for privacy.

I was a member of a left-wing political cult. Right off the bat I want to acknowledge that not all left-wing groups are cults, that it isn't irrational to be a socialist, and that this post isn't some crypto-right-wing honeypot. I personally still harbor anti-capitalist views, and those views unto themselves are not necessarily cultish. I'm also really, really not looking to debate the merits of socialism/communism here.

That all being said, I was a member of a left-wing group that is actually a cult. The group checks off a lot of the cult boxes: strong, charismatic leader that you're not allowed to question; rigid authority roles with minimal accountability of leadership to rank-and-file; a totalizing ideology; love-bombing; extremely overworked members; a ""sacred"" dogma that is functionally unfalsifiable; and so on.

I was heavily involved for several years, and the work I did for them included recruitment and ""ideological development"" of new members. I have a lot of guilt over the role I played in this. After a few years, I, along with some close friends (""comrades"") started becoming disillusioned with the group. We eventually left together and were also basically excommunicated. At first we conceptualized the group as having failed to live up to the principles it espoused, and we intended to seek membership in a different group that would be more effective in carrying out a left-wing revolutionary program.

Since then, independently of each other (we've drifted apart) we've come to realize that it's not just the one group that's cultish, it's the ideology itself -- a particular brand of Marxism, to which at least a few political groups in the US adhere. I more or less ""returned"" to a more orthodox version of Marxism that I felt would be free of the sort of cultishness I encountered with the group's idiosyncratic brand of Marxism.

In the last several years, multiple incidences of sexual misconduct/assault involving members of groups that adhere to this ideology have come to light. And in each instance, the groups in question have moved to suppress and discredit the victims/whistleblowers in order to preserve their feminist reputations.

The most recent instance of this has really hit me hard emotionally, despite having cut nearly all ties with anybody who's affiliated with these groups. It's caused me to question my current politics, which arguably is my one remaining tie to the cult.

Robert Jay Lifton defines ""totalizing ideology"" as it relates to cults:

&gt;“ideas cease to be provisional theories about the world and instead become sacred convictions, dependent on the word of hallowed authorities for their validation rather than evidence.”

And I've noticed that my current flavor of ""orthodox Marxism"" might fit that description. And, more to the point of this post, the idea of dropping or losing my remaining Marxist political analysis and convictions is really hard for me to swallow. I feel like if that happens, there's gonna be a void inside of me that I'll never be able to fill. But if the ideology is the common denominator in all these sexual misconduct incidents and coverups, I don't want to continue to adhere to it. 

I guess I'm hoping to hear from cult survivors who've had to wrestle with similar feelings. Like, if you exited a Christian cult, for example, but were able to stay a Christian in a healthy, fulfilling way, what was it like? How were you able to figure out how to be a member of a religious community in a safe way? Or were you even able to remain a mainstream Christian at all after leaving a Christian cult? 

Do people who exit new age healing cults still practice yoga or whatever in healthy ways? Or do you have to renounce all of that entirely in order to know that you're safe?

Just looking for other people's experiences with this sort of thing I guess."

Lemme know 🤷🏼‍♀️😊"
cults,klu3id,How do you know if you’re in a cult?,"How do you know if you’re in a cult? 

I have a friend who I lived with for awhile after moving to another country ( he is an American but I met him there) who got me into some different religions ideas.
(At the time I would have loosely considered myself a Baptist).

After leaving their house and getting married , I constantly felt a hole in me and longed to live with them again even after my wife and I had two kids and had moved back to the US.
It always felt like him and his dad were the center of the universe and we had some kind of special world of our own . I mean the longing to go back to my old life with them was STONG almost like a physical pain. 

There was nothing gay about this, just a strong need for their approval and friendship, like I went back to being a little kid again and lose myself in being around him.

The feeling was strong enough that it made me question whether I was being manipulated somehow.

There are some things about them that seem to be cultish even though it was only my friend, his wife and dad, not a huge group of giggly weirdos like typical cult.

They believed it was ok to have more than one wife, and before I got married my friend had me explain to my wife what “we” believed and that I might marry more wives in the future. And YES I since explained and took it back to my wife.

It ALWAYS felt like we were busy doing something even though, looking back we never really DID ANYTHING. Dawn till dusk always felt like a flurry of activity with zero free time, but it always felt like heaven. I never could figure out how they did it, but I was NEVER alone. Also when I would talk to my dad on the phone or something my friend would lurk around and make me feel uncomfortable. Also he would prod me to explain the doctrines to my dad or whoever I was talking to. 
BTW my dad didn’t like them at all and neither did my wife. My wife Hated being around them after we were married and basically made me stop seeing them. She always said she felt sick around them.

I later found out that they follow some YouTube personality that they apparently believe is the Second coming of Christ, but after I POINTEDLY asked him if he REALLY believed that he changed the subject and would never give me a straight answer.

I don’t think the religious stuff was the point, except that my friend and his dad were very evasive about their doctrines and I never knew what they really believed in , the would constantly change from day to day.

Also my friend would weirdly flirt with my wife at times and act like he wanted to see how I would react. It was actually over done to the point of being creepy, but I would always brush it off. 
I know that cult leaders have sex with peoples wives and daughters in order to control them, I guess if you let them do that you’ll let them do anything.

The never asked for money and I never gave them ANYTHING. Actually they were extremely generous and actually supported me the whole time I lived with them.

The point is I’ve always been curious how exactly they were able to instantly become the only people in the world I cared about, and have so much control over me.

Anybody understand this?"
cults,klo37l,"Any Hare Krishnas (or former) here? Anyone struggling being ""in between worlds"", not really fitting into either?","I have seen a post of an ex Hare Krishna here recently that received many reies and I wondered if there were more people who are either still practicing, think about leaving or have left the movement entirely.

I feel somehow in between two worlds, not fitting into either the Hare Krishna world anymore, nor into the predominantly irreligious ""normal"" world. I guess it's also a trait of me to always be looking for a box to fit in, even though life is much more complex and beautiful in that way.

Right now I took up practicising a bit at home again after years of rejecting all, such as sewing for Deities but I am no longer vegetarian due to health issues and deficiencies and haven't chanted in years.

I must say that, luckily, I was nerver subjected to abuse or anything nearly like that during my 2-3 very intense years at ISKCON. It was my life and I had planned for this to be my forever thing. Personal things like anxiety came up and I stopped going.
I met wonderful people there but just still can't get over my anxiety issues and more.

Maybe there are others who have/had trouble finding themselves and rearranging their mindset? If you can relate but have been active in a different cult, then that's fine too. I'd love to hear from you! 

Hope everyone will have a great new year!⚘🌺"

I usually don't do this, but because of the utopian, let's-create-a-better-world positioning on their website resembling the utopian, human potential movement cults in the US a half century ago, 

I spent some time [looking into it](https://allatraunites.com/). The guru is former Russian professional ""football"" (probably meaning soccer) player. The organization's HQ is in Kiev, Ukraine. The website claims a large following in the region that extends from Poland to Kurdistan.

The favor itself is irrelevant, but in asking her how she got to the predicament she’s in today was a bit concerning. This friend has always been free spirited and in addition not afraid to experiment with shrooms, LSD, etc. Music festival type (not to stereotype but...).

She said she stayed at a hostel in Virginia and the man who ran the place introduced her to “Jesus” (they don’t actually call it Jesus) and became her mentor. Said the hostel was off the Appalachian Trail and was renovated old church. 

She began praying and talking to “Jesus” and asked him for a man...two weeks later she met the man she had been seeking. They are now married with a baby in Florida. 

They both recently quite their jobs on account of their spiritual journey - they believe that if they ask Jesus for what they want or need he will give it to them. The husband’s family has been financially supporting them. 

So anyways, does this sound familiar to anyone?  I did some research and may have found the hostel in Virginia may be affiliated with the Twelve Tribes. Just trying to understand my friends mindset better so I can understand how to navigate my conversations with her."

I won't go into too much detail about what happened, but it made me admit a childhood event to a family member which shocked and horrified her. What ensued severely damaged my family and pushed me to the brink of suicide multiple times. 

I went to cult-related therapy and did a lot of my own research. People with anger problems have gone on to commit murder after Landmark. People with mild depression have had psychotic episodes and been institutionalized after Landmark. Landmark has been sued multiple times and banned from several countries. 

My therapist - a cult specialist - told me that Landmark deems a 6% ""failure"" rate acceptable -- i.e if  more than 6% of the people in a forum have a bad experience, the forum leader has to get reevaluated. So if one person out of a forum of 400 commits suicide as a result of the experience, that's acceptable to Landmark. I almost felt worse after hearing this. The therapist told me that my reactions to Landmark weren't my fault. I had been blaming myself for months but it was almost worse to know how badly they fucked with my head, i felt utterly disgusting and used. 

I'm trying to see how common my experience was. There aren't really good support groups for victims of this cult. I'm grateful I had my therapist. Things with my family are better though I doubt they'll ever be as close as they used to be. It's been two years since my forum experience and I still think about it every day.

cults,kk7e54,*special* church,"so I've done a lot of deliberation on this topic, and have gotten nowhere, so I decided to bring it to the theologists and others of Reddit! Hello:)

So my church is quite...unique. They claim that they are a special church, called by God, to do a special job in this world. The so-called job is to basically make everyone rapture ready. Now, I've had SEVERAL doubts about this church:

1. Every message is about the rapture. like every.
2. We rarely mention the Gospel. like ever.
3. Whole lotta; BLESSINGS talk :\\ every. single. message.
4. ""what can God do for you, what he MUST do for you"" and no, ""what can WE do for him""

So today, for our service, it was just a lot about, ""you shouldn't leave this ministry; we are different, I (the General superintendent - head pastor) am like a type of Abraham."" then he gave lots of comparisons, and finally concluded that the ministry I go to is very Abraham like, so we should follow, and never leave. Now I don't want to go off too long, I will explain a little more if you'd like, but I've had my suspicions of cult like behaviour within this church, as so my friends have observed too. You know the regular; don't wear pants if your a girl, no jewelry, never leave, the basic works. I've prayed, but nothing. 

So from this explanation, what can you observe? 

1. Is it possible for a church to be specially called out to do God's special work of making everyone saved for rapture? 
2. Is it okay to say that your ministry is likened to Abraham's, and to even call your self a modern Abraham?
3.  An ambiguous claim he made today was that we should get baptized into this specific ministry; is that even okay? anyone; please answer!"

My extended family (grandma, step-grandma, aunt, uncle, two first cousins) have been JWs for my entire life (37F). As a young child, I was informed that they don’t celebrate holidays, so we were never going to have the big family Christmas all my classmates and friends had. My dad died when I was 9, so it’s been just me and my mom for Christmas for the past 28 years. I was told, essentially, to get over it. 

So seeing people moan and wail and act like not seeing extended family for Christmas is tantamount to a war crime and/or child abuse basically makes me feel extremely bitter because it feels like I’m being told that my childhood Christmases with only my mom are so abnormal and horrific that it’s practically torture for young children to be subjected to that. 

And yet I was told, “that’s our family, you can’t have what you want, get over it.” Is it wrong that I want to personally tell every whiny American and Brit this same thing?"

The website starts by asking for personal information - name, email, phone number, and guides you through some sort of ""Journey"" of videos explaining what Rally is, along with small writing prompts. Things like, ""What do you think the meaning of life is?"" or ""Why do you feel like you don't have your meaning?"" 

I've gotten to the point where they wanted to schedule some sort of Zoom meeting; But at the last minute they wanted to reschedule and the calandar link is broken... so... I can't reschedule. So I'm stuck for now.

cults,kitf8s,Need Advice - How do you warn others of a cult with sexual abuse?,"Trying to keep this as basic as possible for obvious reasons. I know of a girl who recently joined a religious organization. This organization seemed like a normal as can be expected church with a social media presence, website, non-profit status, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

After expressing interest in their social media the head of this organization noticed the girl and told others in the group he was going to ""pursue her"" when she joined. Sure enough she joined and the efforts started almost immediately. Over the course of months he slowly got this person to leave their family, believe he had divine insight and power (which he told her meant that God wanted her to submit to him, it was meant to be). There was talk of branding her, changing her legal name, having her leave the country with him etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Total creep right? Here is the thing though, once he got caught it came to light that this is a repeat thing with him, He targets women via this church, brings them in with promises of divine love and then when he is done using them sexually he pushes them out of the church and blocks them from the community. His wife knows, and while she is very upset has allowed him to do this to at least 10 different girls that I can confirm.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I believe I have here is a person in a position of religious authority who legally owns a non-profit status church and is using it to commit sexual assault (Rape by Deception?) against multiple women. The other thing is there are months of communications available from him and his wife confirming all this as evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

I will admit, I am uncertain how to proceed. The last girl has gone to the police, but what else can be done? I've debated blasting the evidence all over their social media to warn others, but that seems risky and ultimately ineffective.

My mom is in a cult, and I don’t know what to do. My mom is a very gullible person and she has been involved in this cult since 2013.

This cult is called HUESA. They brand themselves as an academy that can teach people to transfer their energy and cure/heal others. They set up different levels to teach their followers, each class cost a lot of money, $400 to more. My mom has spent so much money every month towards them. 

The cult operates on a lot of Vietnamese people. They apparently have following everywhere as well. The cult leader Luong Minh Dang died of cancer, his wife Theresa Thu-Thuy Nguyen is now the head of the cult. She currently resides in Australia. She would go online and say crazy sh*t like the people needs to donate all their money to the organization and help save the planet, transferring energy to the planet, and in return, the planet will transfer energy back and save their loved ones. Otherwise, they will regret why they didn’t do enough. My mom has spent thousands of dollars to them, going on multiple retreats, classes, donations. They also say things that intimidates her from leaving, like bad things will happen to her family if she doubt their ideals and try to leave.

My mom has been acting distanced to all her friends and now with us, her family. If we ask or confront her, she will say that you didn’t have the destiny to learn this amazing life changing thing.  If we try to talk to her, she will say that we are controlling her, and taking away her only joy in life. I don’t know what to do, the more we talk to her, the more we drive her away from us and more towards the cult.

This is their website:
https://www.huesa.org

Please help me figure out how to report them. What can we do to alert authorities? They are scamming money and lifesavings off of so many people, taking everything, and isolating their followers from their families and loved ones.

cults,kgax2q,My Close Call With NXIVM,"In 2014/2015 I was a wealthy, young and very impressionable young lady. 

However, I was like a lost little lamb. The people I called friends were only friends with me for the money and lifestyle. And I fed them it as I just wanted to feel loved. I was incredibly alone in the world...even though I was surrounded by many. All I ever wanted and craved were real friends that loved me for me. 

I was a very vulnerable woman in the sense that although I was technically an adult, I had yet to mature. I was still a child in my mind and I was coddled by those around me. The coddling made me act even more child-like which in turn made me need even more protecting. 

Fed up with life, I decided to move from California to NY. I wanted to become more independent and be able to take care of myself. I wanted adventure, I wanted a new life.

A ‘friend of a friend of a friend’ said they would introduce me to a lady in NY who could help me since I didn’t know anyone else in NY. 

This lady spoke to me on the phone several times and was very sweet. I adored her from the minute we spoke. She offered me to stay with her and she would help me settle in.

This lady was Allison Mack.

Due to some family problems, I didn’t end up moving to NY and I stayed in California.

Thank god.

I have only just recently learned about NXIVM and had no idea about any of it. I didn’t know it existed till recently. I also only just found out that the person who introduced us was in fact a member of NXIVM themselves. 

Safe to say I am very shocked and relieved that I didn’t end up in NY with Mack.

cults,kf8fz2,I think my partner tried to drag me into a cult,"I met a woman online. She's a well known businessman and very respected in her field. We met on this sketchy site because I was looking to hookup with someone fetish orientated. Anyway we got talking and she seemed decent. In her 40s, good job, nice house, great communicator, very confident, single too. We instantly got along and started talking about our fantasies. She told me her fetish is touching people whilst her clothes are on. She doesn't like being nude and gets nothing from regular sex. I love being nude and being touched so we just seemed perfect together.

We arranged to meet and she gave me my first sexual experience. It wasn't sex, but I was hooked. She had this talent of just making me feel awesome and I became addicted to what she was doing to me. We went from meeting once, to meeting every other week. That then moved to every week and eventually every other day. I don't have much of a social life so I could meet her whenever she wanted.

Despite it feeling like a good experience I also felt like I spiraled downwards into an unhealthy lifestyle. I started taking drugs she supplied to heighten my pleasure. I'd spend hours being massaged, groped, masturbated. It was like she had this unquenchable appetite to make me feel good and it was impossible to say no to her when she asked me to meet up. Things got more and more taboo and weird. Depravity felt like it started to become normal for me. Before I met her I never would have thought about doing any of the things I let her do to me.

Things went down the route of having people watch her do things to me. Then it moved onto them doing things to me too. I knew so many men and women who had seen me and touched me, but I had really no idea who they were other than the fact they were her ""friends"". There was no intimacy. I was an object of their fantasies just the same as they became objects for me.

My partner invited me to a party. She made out it was very important to her and a party with a couple of friends. It turned out to be a very posh looking manor house. The theme was masquerade so everyone was wearing masks. It felt like I was in a movie and not real life. People we being served food and drinks, classical music. I had never been in that sort of environment ever. I met a lot of the people my partner called ""friends"" who had been involved sexually with me too.

A guy came over and greeted us. He was really touchy feely and kept hugging my partner. He also pulled me towards his crotch a bit during the hug which made me feel really uncomfortable. My partner referred to him as the ""guru"". He was talking to me about sex and it made me feel uncomfortable. He said that everyone here started off like I did and they all work their way up to get where they are. I was very uncomfortable and started to feel like I was being treated like I owed them something. It made me feel pretty scared to be honest.

Everyone had a meal then there was an orgy. It disgusted me and I wanted to leave, but my partner made me stay. People touched me who I didn't want. Fat people put their genitalia near me. It was gross and left me feeling very dirty afterwards. I didn't consent to any of it, but they didn't seem to understand the word no.

After it was over lots of different people were talking to me telling me how great it is to be a part of their ""select group"". Telling me that if you sacrifice yourself for another's pleasure someone would do the same for you. Told me that ""no fantasy is unobtainable here"" and that ""there is something for everyone"". I was also told that they had contacts that could get me anything I desired. I said that I would think about it and a guy said ""no one ever says no"".

After my partner gave me a lift home I talked to her over the phone and told her I didn't like what was going on at that place. I'm worrying because she knows where I live. She has text me telling me how I can't just ghost her and that I've used her and given nothing in return. She's telling me to at least come to the next party and see if it's better the second time and that I at least owe her that.

I told my friend and he laughed at me and said it was a sex cult. I'm posting this here to see what people say. Don't tell me to go back there because I wont."
cults,kf7wc0,"Trying to find a specific cult story, militant feminist group.","Several years ago I watched a random Investigation Discovery series about escaping cults. One of them was a woman who had joined a feminist activist group in the 60s or 70s. Her leader was a prominant voice at a major university that kind of kicked off the general movement. I believe they moved their group to California and started recruiting and slowly got more radical and militant. The woman telling of her experiences mentioned the many tortuous isolation and deprivation techniques that were used against them, how they eventually started calling each other ""Comrade,"" and that it wasn't until her I'll mother died in their apartment without her present after working solid 20 hour days that she was finally able to snap out of it and escape. 

There are so many docs about cults (The Vow or Heaven's Gate) that are popular right now and my sifting hasn't dug up much at all. ""Radical feminist"" and ""feminist cult"" are also so prominant in our lexicon and discourse. Maybe my google search is gunked up? I just found the 30ish minute episode so fascinating and I'd love to read up about it again.

Anyone ever go on a retreat here as a kid? I have some weird memories from when I went. I heard they discontinued it a couple of years ago. I remember doing weird group hugs around this big tree for 15-20 minutes without talking. I also remember not being allowed a watch or anything that could tell the time while I was there. Our phones were locked in a box on the top floor. They had a lot of symbolism I wasn’t used to (being Roman Catholic growing up). A lot of weird statues and a weird looking amphitheatre that always seemed to be empty. I remember being woken up by a nun at probably 4-5 am and being led through the building into this hallway lined with thousands of tiny candles, and an unsettling song being played. All the nuns were wearing hooded robes instead now and wouldn’t let anyone talk. We were all led up into this creepy chapel one by one and sat there for 30 minutes. They said some vague shit about faith and accepting jesus as your leader which I just ignored. I don’t think it was necessarily a cult, I just have quite a few strange experiences from my time there. One girl got screamed at by a nun for talking to her friend during breakfast, until she was in tears, two hours later she was sent home. Another odd thing was remembering my teacher breaking down crying by herself, and abruptly walking away when she saw me coming up to her. I’m sure I can remember other things that happened but it’s been a number of years.

Did anyone else have weird experiences going here?

TL;DR

Super strict nuns

Teachers and students breaking down crying

Weird tree hugging tradition

Hooded robe surprise chapel visit with thousands of candles

""A member of the anti-government Boogaloo Bois pleaded guilty Wednesday to attempting to provide weapons to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, in the days and weeks following protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 

Benjamin Ryan Teeter, 22, could face up to 20 years in prison for the federal felony. His sentencing has not been scheduled. 

Appearing via video and wearing orange jail garb, Teeter told U.S. District Judge Michael Davis that he came to Minneapolis from North Carolina after Floyd's death. He and Michael Robert Solomon, 30, another Boogaloo Bois member who's charged with the same crimes, met several times with two men they believed represented Hamas, but who were actually working covertly for the federal government. Teeter and Solomon negotiated selling gun suppressors and a ""drop in auto sear"" — a device that converts semi-automatic weapons into illegal machine guns, according to charges. 

Teeter acknowledged in court he believed the materials would be used by the militant wing of Hamas. ""I mean, why would someone buy suppressors if they weren't going to deliver them to a militant wing?"" he said. 

Teeter said they hoped Hamas would help them ""to exit the country and open a training facility"" for Boogaloo Bois, a loose-knit, far-right group bent on starting the next American civil war. He and Solomon also planned to bomb a courthouse in northern Minnesota, and then changed their target to an unspecified courthouse in the Twin Cities, he said in court Wednesday. 

""This case highlights the real threat posed by domestic violent extremists who self-radicalize and threaten to violently attack others opposed to their views, with little or no warning,"" said Michael Paul, special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis field office, which led the investigation.""

My mum has started calling it a cult since we moved away or “escaped” you could say. My mum had no money as my dad had cut us off to stop us from leaving. We’ve been away for 2 years and I finally feel free. I had good moments but I had some of my lowest. Rumours and judgement. Slut-shaming and rumours about me having orgies at 14? Crying my eyes out and just wanting to die but no I can’t even do that because it’s said that you’ll haunt this earth as a ghost for 700yrs. So you’re stuck. I learned about chastity for a whole year in school. You learn more and more about the scriptures in this course called Bhakti Sastri which starts at 8am (you go there after your morning temple programs which consist of 4am- Mangal Arati. Then you sit outside and chant your rounds. 7am- Darshan Arati then go straight to Bhakti Sastri) which is a daily routine except weekends which aren’t forced because of school. But it looks good if you do and you’re considered a good devotee.

If a married person wants to leave a Haredi community and live another way, the process of divorce can be profoundly rupturing and contentious. For the children of a couple in this situation, no judge can help them reconcile the differing messages about life that they hear from their parents.

Raised Foursquare Gospel Pentecostal but decidedly OUT of that world after my three-year excursion to Southeast Asia, I was dismayed (to put it mildly) by what I saw in the Real World. A few years in the plastic fantastic BS of the commercial hustle thereafter left me looking for The Answer. In short order, I went looking for it in the Church of Scientology, [The Center for Feeling Therapy](https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/8f7mf0/the_center_for_feeling_therapy/), and Werner Erhard's est, the forerunner of the Landmark Forum. After which I was even *more* dismayed, plowing into more sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll than I could stand for most of a decade. (Much as predicted by an article published in *New Times Magazine* about two years after it ran the piece that opened the floodgates for est in 1974.)

Most of the books in [A Basic Cult Library](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/9pxnel/a_basic_cult_library/) capture my experiences in bits and pieces. Stein's gets far closer to the total of it. A perusal of [Bowlby's theory](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=adult+attachment+types), Susan Forward's [***Emotional Blackmail*** &amp; the FOG of Fear, Obligation &amp; Guilt](https://www.google.com/search?q=emotional+blackmail&amp;oq=emotional+blackmail&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5701j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), and The Way Out via [Re-Development](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8m565s/redevelopment/) will hopefully suffice to explain all that sufficiently for most people.

cults,kdddw6,How to know for sure if I was in a cult,"Hi everyone. I can’t go too Into detail because this story could identify me pretty easily. How can I tell if something was a cult? About a year ago (as a very young teen) I joined a voice acting thing online. The leader wasn’t an outright charismatic dude, in fact he was kind of cringe, but he did a lot of brainwashing and programming type things. I was not outright told this, but it was kind of drilled into our heads that he was the almighty and a god, and we were the characters that we voiced. There’s a lot more, but again I can’t go too much into detail. He was about 18, and one day made an offer to train me “to make me really powerful”. He then revealed he had done the same to my friend, without her knowledge. Today, Shes very loyal to him. One of his “angels” as I’ve come to call it. Anyway, I was kicked out after I reported him to the group where we met. He then got rid of me and over the past year has told his growing following that I was just very mentally unstable. I’ve told a few ppl about this, and they either automatically assume I was a victim of RA or ask me (or tell me) I was in a cult. Can someone help me figure this out? I just want to know what happened and help my friend. DM me for more details if you need. Thanks!"

My mom had a client who told her abt OTO and it matches up with my aunt. She has had an odd obsession with bunnies, which have to do w fertility in OTO. Her husband has always been secretive about his jobs, always says he's ""helping out a friend"". He has always wanted my aunt to have lots of kids, all of whom have unusual names (they currently have 3). The main sign, was when they met, my moms sister instantly changed after meeting this guy, and cut us off completely.

Also, they have lived in 3 of the cities with big OTO temples. After researching, I learned that sex is viewed as a ritual in that group, which makes sense for them. Their young girls have been exposed to sexual content many many times (porn, walking in on parents, tv and movies). Also, my aunt describes sex w him as a ""transcendence"". 

Anyways, I came across this sub and was interested in what people would have to say about this. There isn't much on the internet about oto, so I thought I'd ask, and I'm curious if it seems like they might be involved w it"

cults,kcfo72,Cults and Critical Thinking,"A cult is taught to have faith when it doesn’t understand something rather than seeking a rational alternative.

In a cult, critical thinking is discouraged. Thinking contrary to the established religious narrative is considered “impure” and therefore forbidden (I.e. scientific rationale that contradicts religious rhetoric).

A cult is taught to respect and obey a leader or a system of leaders based on the abstract, untestable narrative that that leader(s) is/are chosen of God. Critical thinking and action that goes against the man’s narrative is considered an abomination and disobedience to God.

A cult may emphasize external originated feelings rather than the use of one’s own brain and reasoning to lead own choices.

A cult my perpetuate the narrative that the outside world is wicked and evil. A cult actively shuns alternate ways of thinking. This creates a lack of understanding of the perspectives of others coupled with a complex of grandiosity. The members now hold their positions regardless of evidence and often with a lack of understanding of what constitutes evidence. This entails strong confirmation bias and lack of critical thinking skills.

Cults often perpetuate the narrative that if one person disobeys God, the whole family or cult suffers. This line of thought creates fear of adverse responses to critical thinking from the peer group.

Those who perpetuate cult mentality for personal gain and power know that they can control masses as long as the masses are conditioned to shun critical thinking. Therefore, cultists are thought not only to fear but to despise and to mock the exercise of critical thinking.

Cults fear an unfettered mind because a free thinking mind, eager and willing to ask questions and challenge the norm, leads to freedom."

cults,kbyf76,Theory: The Level of Government Involvement in Heaven's Gate (LONG POST)," Hey everyone. New to the sub, and new to the Heaven's Gate cult outside of just the basic cultural knowledge and jokes I've heard about it growing up. Just finished watching the HBO documentary with my girlfriend and decided to do a bit more digging after something struck me as odd.

Now, up front, I will say I have no definitive proof of anything here and can certainly understand why what I'm about to lay out may come across as if I've gone full schizo-mode. I'm a relatively normal dude, I promise. I just happen to believe that where there's smoke, there is usually fire.

In episode two of the HBO series, Frank Lyford opens up about his cousin David Van Sinderen. Frank comments that his David's father was the president of Southern New England Telecommunications, had connections to the FBI, and even went so far as to travel around the country with agents looking for the group. It is also later revealed that the cult in fact lived off of David's trust fund for quite some time.

When I was watching the show, this immediately sent off a bit of an alarm. Knowing what I do about the history of our country's three-letter agencies, the amount of power and resources they held during Heaven's Gate's active years (and still do), and their penchant for experimentation, I immediately thought something wasn't right.

It made no sense to me why David Van Sinderen was still allowed access to the trust fund that his father, a corporate leader with ties to the Feds, undoubtedly set up for him. Especially if this man wanted his son home, or at least properly accounted for.

It made even less sense to me that the FBI of the 1970's couldn't manage to track down and locate these missing person's who were using that trust fund to:

A) Conspicuously renting out large homes in well-to-do neighborhoods

B) Actively marketing and recruiting new members in public spaces

C) Using a traceable and otherwise notable account for their purchases

As soon as I finished processing these thoughts, I turned to my girlfriend and said, ""There's no way the FBI or CIA doesn't have someone involved in this whole thing.""

We decided that after we finished the series, I was to do some digging. Here's what I've found out so far about David's father, Alfred Van Sinderen:

After serving as a Naval officer in WWII, Alfred returned home and attended Yale. However, not only did he attend Yale, he also was a member of Phi Beta Kapp, the oldest academic honors society, and rather known for churning out some of the most prolific and, in my estimate, evil people in our country's history. He attended the same time as George HW Bush, who served as the director of the CIA from 1976-1977, or, right about the time Heaven's Gate was truly ramping up.

Following Yale, he attended Harvard and received his Master's in business education, graduating the same year as notable anti-communist and all-around reprehensible fellow named Henry Kissinger. Kissinger would go on to serve as our National Security adviser for Reagan and then Secretary of State for Nixon.

Of course, this is all circumstantial and certainly doesn't mean that Alfred Van Sinderen was in cahoots with the top leaders of our country. However, any objective look at Yale and Harvard would yield a conclusion that both of these institutions are the two most well-lubricated pipelines between the private sector and the military industrial / national intelligence sectors. So, it should come as no surprise when Alfred Van Sinderen immediately winds up as a high-ranking employee at Southern New England Telecommunication (SNET) (now AT&amp;T) following his graduation from Harvard.

Where things start to get really interesting here is when Alfred becomes the Chariman and Chief Executive Officer of SNET in 1967. What wouldn't be exposed until 1977 via expose in The New Haven Journal Courier was a joint operation conducted by SNET alongside of the FBI to wiretap and spy on over 3000 Connecticut residents in an effort to identify and quell any individual or organization that threatened the United States' political stability. For anyone well-versed in the history of the FBI's myriad of criminal activities against US citizens, this was a part of, yes you guessed it, COINTELPRO. Alfred Van Sinderen worked directly with the FBI on one of the largest homeland spying operations of its time.

So, overall, please forgive me if I do not buy the fact that Alfred's son was unable to be found by the same FBI that his father had deep and direct connections with, but was also still allowed to drain his trust fund in order to supply Heaven's Gate with the funds it needed to operate.

I am only just starting to pull on these threads, and it may be nothing, but like I said earlier, I think that were there is smoke there is likely fire. And here, there seems to be a lot of smoke. You do not serve in the United States military, become a member in (barring Skull &amp; Bones) the most prominent and conspiracy-riddled society at Yale alongside future CIA Director / President G.H.W. Bush, attend Harvard with famously ruthless anti-communist Kissinger, gain control of the largest telecom company on the eastern seaboard, aid the FBI in running COINTELPRO operations out of said company, and then several years later get bested by the likes of Herf Applewhite.

I don't know David's level of involvement, but speculate he may have been a mole. His suicide would suggest otherwise, but I'm interested in seeing [u/benprodnuk](https://www.reddit.com/u/benprodnuk/)'s upload of the medical reports to look for anything fishy. Witness protection, faking a death, relocation, etc., is however certainly the FBI's bread and butter.

Did the FBI know more about the cult than they let on? Did they have an inside man? Were they funding it themselves and using the trust fund as a smoke screen? Would having a giant group of people who dressed in the same clothes and shared everything with each other commit suicide in front of the nation help the US Government's anti-communist agenda? Was this an extension of COINTELPRO? I don't know, but something is fishy here.

Let me know what you think.

As someone who’s had friends and family get tied up in cult movements (both Christian and non), this greatly concerns me.

I’ve been trying to argue, both on Reddit and in person, that while the Falun Gong might *currently* align with American Christian conservatives on some issues (mainly the danger of Communist China), I get a ton of pushback from people who believe ET is an awesome unbiased source and/or their agenda is nothing to be wary of.

Let me emphasize this isn’t a blanket hostility towards non-Christians, or Buddhist or Taoist roots the Falun Gong hearken to, and I’m not calling for censorship or limitations on religious freedom. But as far as I understand, the Falun Gong are a flat-out cult with an egotistical prophet and coercive methodology mixed with heretical fusion beliefs. But I would greatly appreciate it if people could recommend reading materials or offer suggested lines of argument that conservative Christians would consider credible, that I can go on to use to convince others to at least be *cautious* in trusting the Epoch Times."

An example of what I'm referring to is the Snowden stuff, who after being forgiven for his trespasses, gets to go on tour as a celebrity to seed paranoia. He basically acts as an authority figure to confirm even mild paranoia that the existing patterns and trends in language already promote but otherwise might be dismissed by someone. These then snowball via confirmation bias to full fledged paranoia and psychosis.  The government doesn't have to spy on people if the people believe they're being spied on, it functions in the same way that the cult leader doesn't have to be god if the suckers believe he or she is... They're prisoners of their own belief and the believers go out seeding the toxicity for others to believe or buy into and spread. If you really pay attention you can see these patterns (like the usage of major archetypes) all over. Its kind of sad, really."

2. **Let's Talk About Sects:** the hostess is australian so you'll see several groups from that part of the world such as Anne-Hamilton Byrne's The Family and  Serge Benhayon's Universal Medicine
3. **Heaven's Gate :** hosted by Glynn Washington of Snap Judgment, the name is pretty self-explanatory. Six parts series on the infamous UFO cult
4. **The Gateway: Teal Swan:** another six parts series, this time on the tech-savvy cult of Teal Swan
5. **Dear Franklin Jones:** a man raised as part of this guru's cult interviews his parents, experts and other members of the group to find out what really happened in ""Adi Da's"" group
6. **The Cult Vault**: this one has lots of interviews, not my favorite but interesting nonetheless
7. **Coffee and Cults**: the audio is really lacking but the hosts are fun and they often talk about less-known groups"

cults,k9lxd6,NXIVM anyone have any theories or info?,So I’ve basically listened to every podcast and watched every documentary about nxivm and I find this cult so interesting but I feel like there’s still a lot that I don’t know. Does anyone know anything about the cult that hasn’t been portrayed on mainstream media? I also would like to know peoples opinions on the “victims” that are mostly portrayed like Mark Vicente and Sarah Edmondson. Like do you think they knew a lot more of the things that were going on behind the curtains and could’ve potentially been complicit in some of these toxic and illegal activities?

cults,k86uri,Brooke Castillo Life Coaching Cult?,"Cult-y NXIVM-like rhetoric in Brooke Castillo’s life coaching school, plus the sky-high fees, lifetime memberships, and pattern of recruitment makes me feel this is a cult?

I have a family member who went through Brooke Castillo’s life coaching “school” and have seen it take over her relationships, every conversation she has, her entire life. I listened to a podcast about NXIVM and felt they shared disturbingly similar schools of belief, and noticed the ways in which the members of the cult spoke about their experiences as they became more entangled and the way they lived and breathed the message and the way their loved ones responded and it struck an eerie chord. 

Haven’t found anything like this on the web or anyone else sharing these sentiments but wanted to start a dialogue."

I either read or watched part of a documentary a long time ago about a cult, and after watching the new Heavens Gate HBO documentary I've been trying to find out what it was.

All I can remember is this.

One of the members had to carry around a chair on his back for the leader, and he (and others) were being talked into counselling sessions by the leader. Paying him $50 a session and actually getting raped/abused in these sessions and having to continually go back week after week.

Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Sorry that's all I have to go off. 

Thankyou!"

cults,k7rgcu,My town may have a cult,"I live in Central California, not gonna give to much info away as I'm sure a few of you may be able to at least guess the area with just that info, but regardless I live in a mountain area. 

It's mostly rough roads, deer, very conservative, but is well traveled to get to one of the National Parks here, basically it's a ""Through Town"" As I like to call them. 

Our Town is extremely Christian and Mormon, the High School that I went to for my first two years it was highly recommended everyone joined one of the three or four Christian classes for one of our required elective classes as most the other choices weren't very wide besides Art and a few others. 

For personal reasons, I had already lost my religionat this point, so I was very much not interested in joining the classes, and many of my friends in my group did too. 

I left after my Sophomore year to another county. But after that and a year of College, I moved back near the town and started living there with my friends then my family. I had lost contact with everyone that I was friends with there, but my job let's me see them every once in awhile, and I was able to catch up with them. 

They had all converted to what they call ""Higher Christian Tenants"", at least thats what it sounded like they called it. When I asked why they switched, they only told me that something higher up had convinced them and changed their view of the world. 

And yes they did say ""Something"", not Someone. I didn't even catch this till way later. 

I asked my parents, who are both Christian but don't go to church, about this group and they think I'm making it up, but my Mom asked her co-worker, who I went to school with, about it. She warned my Mom to not mention them publicly. 

She used to be apart of one of the Mormon churches but after she got pregnant during High school, she was kicked from the Church, but luckily her family is still very supportive of her. 

I decided to ask her myself the other day about this group, and here's what she told me summarized:

""They're a Christian group, I think it got started by one of the community center across the street from the High School. He came to the school a few times during our Junior and Senior year, and had even had a few College tuitions promised if we completed one of his three year long courses or something like that. It didn't make much sense to me, especially with what I knew about the churches. When I walked past the class he was borrowing for the week to show the kids what his church and their teachings were like, that class was full of not just the kids but a few of their parents I think. I remember a lot of kids over the next few months were pushing the teachings to a lot of the kids like you who weren't very religious. Ever sense they haven't been at the school last year, but I know I've seen a shit ton of them in their weird Orange and yellow striped shirts and jackets. They are freaky, and I know a bunch of the people from my old Church and Lincolns (our auto teacher) church also left to join them, it wasn't just kids joining, and I don't even know where they practice their studies, I've heard online classes but one of my dad's friends said he's seen a bunch of them off the Highway towards the middle of the wooded area by the True Value""

These were said between questions and such but I don't remember every little thing she said. She mostly said that if I asked about them to a known member that they somehow find out where most people live and would give out these weird business cards. If I ever find one I'll post a picture of it long as it doesn't show where I live. 

Reason why I wanted to post it today was because I asked my girlfriend about it, her family is Super Christians so I figured she'd know more about it, and she basically told me ""My parents don't like them at all, take the Christian ideals and twist it into a weird...uhg I don't know how to explain it, all I know is that they were harassing my dad and he had to call the police on one of them who kept coming to the house""

She told me I should ask this to someone else, and I don't know how wide spread this group is, if it's only in my town, or maybe someone here has also had an encounter with them. 

Oh and one more thing, apparently the member was caught having sexual relations with one of the younger members. If I learned this happened to one of my friends against their will, well, let's say I might take down a religious group without the need of them killing themselves."
cults,k7nwnv,I'm confused about some things involving India Oxenberg. NXIVM,"When was it exactly that India found the thumbdrives?

cults,k7e5b9,Just watched Seduced... what do you think of this?,"I don’t know if anyone has seen it but I noticed very early on that the sociologist (can’t remember her name) said that NXIVM and Keith R was the worst cult leader she has every worked on in her 40 years as a sociologist. I understand NXIVM and Dos was a horror story and while I find some problems with who’s a victim and who’s not I do not think it’s comparable with Jonestown. Both were horrific. Keith was extremely good at mass manipulation and the extent of how he basically reprogrammed the minds of men and women to turn their morals upside down to the point they worshiped a man who spoke about rape and children in a way that would make you sick. But then we have Jim Jones. Can we compare them? Are they 2 totally different examples of a cult? Or is one absolutely worse than the other? I do not mean that the victims of one are not victim enough to be seen as the worst of the two, I’m genuinely curious as I have seen people say NXIVM is the worst they’ve ever studied/heard about and I’m just not sure this is the case. What do you guys think?"
cults,k7b2jp,Sex was a regular part of it. Has anyone had this kind of experience?,"I was exposed to sex from a young age. I was told that everyone has to do it. It is a way to fight the outer world.

In my commune, it was normal for adults to have sex with girls of younger ages. Now, thinking about this, it haunts me, I am traumatized by all of the things that have happened to me since I was a child."

&amp;#x200B;

 Looking for anyone that might know what went down there. It seems like christ cults just funneled people from one to the next after things got too extreme, they'd shut down, people would join another, that was less crazy, then it would get crazy again, then again and again. Seems like a lot of calvary chapels are on the cusp of collapse. The smaller ones with less oversite from the mega church. But I mean the megachurch is crazy too."

cults,k6eygh,Stigma of labels harms resolution process,"The problem isn’t cults. Imo It’s cult behavior. even that has a stigma. 
It’s the idea of group thinking without criticism. Trying to understand how I resolve cult behavior and how I learn lets me communicate with people and I stop when I cross a line or they cut me out of their life. I do feel like this is the best method currently but the us/them mentality is in cultures of all walks of society and life. Religion is just a stigma when over used in my opinion for the pathway to realizing I’m tripping over myself on this issue. Do you think that could be true for how you feel in some way or am I way of?
Again imo
It’s the idea of group thinking without criticism. I just got kicked out of a recovering from religion group exhibiting this because I said there should be no reason why we can’t organize community feedback better and process it."
cults,k6d9fo,Jim Jones and the People's Temple," In a recent r/AskReddit there was a question about a ""dark secret"" in your hometown's history. May I present to you my hometown shared with the original  People's Temple. These days the building they used is a christian denomination. I'd walk by the building everyday after school (when I had to walk) and later on after work (when I walked because I developed an audiobook habit).

Jim Jones and his People's Temple cult spent a good long time living there before fleeing to Guyana. My high school biology teacher (for some reason) spent a whole class period talking about the time she and her husband spent an evening talking with Jim Jones in her hot tub at some point in the 60's.

""Jones had influential friends in government, both in Mendocino County and San Francisco, which he made his new base in the mid-1970s.""

""His top aide for years was Tim Stoen, then Mendocino County's assistant district attorney.""

Stoen, now a deputy district attorney in Mendocino County, defected from the temple and became one of its sharpest critics before the mass suicide in Jonestown but was unable to retrieve his son, who died there. Stoen declined to be interviewed for this story."""

I'm a 14 year old male and I live in a small town in Oregon. A few months ago me and my friends discovered an organization in our town called Job's Daughters. As it turns out the majority of the girls in our grade and a few grades above and below are in this organization. They have a building where they meet up and it looks very old. I think that Job's Daughters are a form of freemasons, but im not sure.
My friends asked one of the girls what it was and if it was a cult type things and she yelled at them and told them it wasnt a cult, then she started crying and hid in the bathroom for the rest of the day. I felt bad so i dropped it until I was walking today and found the building and I cant stop thinking about it. I need answers.
All I know so far is that it's a very secretive organization that recruits girls at a very young age and they go to the building and have secret meetings  there. If anyone could help me understand more about it and why it exists I would greatly appreciate it."

My mom and I are no longer JWs but we respect her and understand that at her age this is one thing that keeps her happy and motivated to wake up everyday. I love my grandma so much so once a week I sit with her and let her discuss their teachings with me and I engage to help her feel she’s doing something good for their cause. I realize that even though I STRONGLY dislike the organization as a whole she’s a great woman who thinks she is really helping people. 

So this happened today I’m sure everyone is aware of the letter writing campaign that they are doing. Well this morning someone came to our home to confront her about the letter why she wrote it and how she got their name/address. I always answer the door and I know the basics so I tried to answer their questions but they barged inside running through our house looking for her. He started saying he wanted to kill her so she would stop spreading the word of a cult and the devil. Thankfully he went the opposite way and I could lock us in her room we had to call the police and have the guy forcefully removed. She’s a 78 year old woman who truly believes in what she is doing this was very scary for her and for me. Thankfully she’s hard of hearing so I am unsure if she heard the threat or was pretending to be strong for me. She always put the return address to the Kingdom Hall but this time I’m assuming the guy looked up her name in the phone book and found our address. I guess you could say pay back is a bitch. 

While many in the organization may be malicious not all of them are please remember a lot of these people truly believe in what they are doing. Talk to them with kindness even if you disagree and they are annoying because I get it better than anyone. While I agree it probably is a cult it takes no effort to be nice also don’t try to barge into peoples homes."

When she dropped out I did also. I remember getting a letter of being disowned or whatever term they used. The meetings were very secretive. Girls held positions of Faith, Hope, Love, And Worthy Advisor. They moved up those ranks and then had a chance at Grand Worthy Advisor where there was a big conference and a big deal was made out of it. This was like a jr high and highschool popularity contest. Girls had to vote with a white or black ball when moving girls up in the ranks. I remember someone getting a black ball once. This was very uncommon and people were very upset. I don't think the adult leaders were very good people. There were dues and other costs and you were pushed to attend every activity. CULT."

cults,k4h22v,"BLack Masonry, the real cult behind BLM.","What is black masonry?  What is freemasonry in general?  What are the origins?  What is clandestine and regular masonry?  What does this clandestine Masonic movement have to do with Black Lives Matter and why is this a seditious conspiracy?  Here are the answers.

Black masonry is a clandestine version of regular freemasonry, which owns buildings, has things like tax returns and bank accounts, and has a public and legal presence in the world.  Clandestine masonry is more like a mafia gang.  The are no rules or tax returns and instead they actually kill people instead of just talking about it.  For those who don't know, regular freemasonry is like a drama club where they stage a greek play around the new pledge about the construction of the temple of jerusalem.  There are clandestine Masonic organizations which are legal entities, but they are really just unaffiliated with the united grand lodge of england, which is basically like the Vatican of freemasonry.  Practically all of the cult groups of the past few centuries from the golden dawn to mormons and the Reformed church in america are all ripped off from regular masonry and use the masonic ritual as the secret core initiation ritual for their group.  Anyway, the ritual practiced on Wednesday night in lodges is basically a model where in public without revealing themselves a lodge will swarm around a target and kill them.  Black people call this BRINGING someone and the police also use the term to refer to bring someone to justice.  When black people use the term bring, they mean to kill them.  They will try to try to separate white people from their community and other white people so they can target them with rape and coercion.  If you ever see white people acting black it is because gangs of black people ""brung"" them.  Again, beware the use of the term ""bring"" because it is a codeword means they will try to kill or rape someone.  

Black masonry is not the regular prince hall affiliated masonry which is considered regular and affiliated with the grand lodge in England.  Black masonry is like a gang of gangs using freemasonic ritual to induct dupes.  This group also has violent, militant, and extremist terrorist beliefs using war crimes like murdering civilians with poison squads, kidnapping, rape, reproductive coehersion, extortion, etc. but most of all murdering white people, raping jews, etc. and essentially targeting individuals because of race.  Terms like Racial Justice are really code for Rape Jews using the first letter of each word to have a different meaning.  All of this terrorist activity is actually more in line with historical freemasonry than the genteel verbal version created as a play for aristocrats who could afford the dues.  Black masonry is more like the grand lodge of Cairo which was as murderous as they were huge.  The white version historically was basically the police or more accurately the fraternal order of police which is again based on regular masonry but without Masonic affiliation.  Black Masonry is more comparable to the klan, but for black people.  Like the klan, also ripped off from masonry by famous freemason Albert Pike, Black Masonry is a fundamentally racist and fascist extremist organization employing extra-judicial terrorist techniques to maintain influence and discipline.  Also, like the klan in their prime, BLackMasonry is considered politically popular and acceptable despite extremist views and terrorist activity."

I grew up in the entertainment world, and have a lot of first hand experience with assholes using cult techniques to control or influence artists. 

My friend and I just watched the 4 part doc on Showtime about the incredibly talented and successful producer Rick Rubin and his involvement with the TM cult. Which is a cult. No doubt.

There are lots of non-famous people identified as spiritual advisors, then naturally Sadhguru and David Lynch and Carlos Santana show up.

I really ruined the show for my friend by pointing out how they all sat around spouting the exact same nonsense as Keith Raniere.

This talk I watched about how Elvis Presley was suckered by spiritual hucksters was interesting to me. Same cult tactics from the same Ascended Masters hoax led by the Theosophists really did a number on Elvis.

cults,k3zjke,I left a cult without realizing I was in one,"Lately I’ve been thinking about when I was younger and what was a big influence on me and how things had changed for me up until now. When I was younger around 2-8 years old my family would attend this church that I will not disclose the name of, if you would like the name plz dm me, this church was a huge building with one big room full of pews and different bowls of water in front of them, and every Sunday we were told that we’d all have to drink from the bowl to be all be interconnected with eachother to make our prayers stronger so god could hear us, but that was when I was 8, around 5 years old I was forced to go to the church every day after school already going to a private school at the time it would get very exhausting to be hearing about god. But no fits could keep me from returning to the church everyday, particular days I remember that the youth pastor at the time would have one of my other friends lay down on the ground and we throw the water from the pews at him, and the youth pastor would chant these hymns that in all honesty now sounded like it were French or italian, but this man was American, the whole premise of this church was to be interconnected together to be able to get god to hear us, so when we have a snack like Oreos, a sand-which, or even crackers we all bite from the same food like one person would bite a sandwich and then pass it on to the next person and it would continue until the sandwich was gone. Another time I was convinced by the main pastor that I needed to be giving money to the church and if I wasn’t I was going to hell, and let me explain to you how they explained to me what hell was. Hell to the church was demonstrated that if you misbehaved while in church they would “send you to hell” and what it was, is a closet inside a banquet room that was never used, and they’d leave you there for 30min to an hour, and after released being the dumb gullible 6 year old, they had told me if I told my parents then they’d take me right back to the closet, and I do remember that I had told my mom that i didn’t want to attend anymore, and basically she said that if I didn’t attend that god wouldn’t hear us and we would go to hell for not talking to god.

cults,k2wy1k,What non-religious places have you found have unexpected cult like dynamics and structure to them?,
cults,k2w4lu,Terra Joulle? Is Terra Joulle a Cult?,"

To answer this question, you 
need first to ask yourself 
what is your definition of a cult and what about Terra Joulle makes it a cult.

We will explain the various 
views of a cult and then 
you can decide if you see us 
as a cult and more specifically, what kind of 
cult.

The first website we chose 
provides you with essential information on how 
to recognize a cult:
 
https://www.wikihow.com/Tell- 
if-a-Church-is-a-Cult

-----------------------:

Religious cults consist of groups of 
people who adhere to a strict 
belief system and organize 
around a charismatic leader. 
Unlike a church, a religious 
cult is destructive and uses 
fear and manipulation to 
command their membership.

--------------


""There is not a leader in 
Terra Joulle and there is not 
a group that tells you what you 
must do. There is nobody in 
Terra Joulle that will say 
that you must follow someone 
or a group. There is the Terra 
and it is your own choice how 
much you follow from the 
Terra. It is a support in life.
Terra Joulle is against making 
one person or one group 
special. People do not believe 
they can reach the same thing 
if they see someone as 
special. You see someone 
as special because you think they 
can do things you can’t. You 
can do the same.
That is one of the biggest 
reasons that there are no 
people in Terra Joulle that 
are coming to the front. We 
are altogether special.

Please read more on Wikihow to 
understand how a cult works and 
how to recognize a cult. How Wikihow 
describes are we not a cult.""


The next 2 of information about 
cults is provided by: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
Cult
-------------


In modern English, a cult is a 
social group that is defined 
by its unusual religious, 
spiritual, or philosophical 
beliefs, or by its common 
interest in a particular 
personality, object, or goal.

----------------

""Terra Joulle have a very 
unusual spiritual and 
philosophical beliefs. We have 
also a lot personal goals that 
we want to reach in life.
This sounds clear.
In the real modern English 
Taal we are a cult""

-------------
An older description of the 
word cult is a set of 
religious devotional practices 
that are conventional within 
their culture, are related to 
a particular figure, and are 
often associated with a 
particular place. References 
to the ""cult"" of a particular 
Catholic saint, or the 
imperial cult of ancient Rome, 
for example, use this sense of 
the word.
----------

Terra Joulle is not a 
religion. It is a lifestyle.
Terra Joulle only share the 
Terra. People can follow the 
rules they want.
None of the rules are negative 
for the body and mind.
It is created so you can learn 
to be yourself. To be the 
real you.



The last tool to see if Terra 
Joulle is a cult or not is the 
best tool available. It is the 
BITE Model tool developed by Steven 
Hassan. It is a comprehensive 
list used to describe the 
specific methods that cults 
use to recruit and maintain 
control over people. The 
purpose of this site is to 
examine where and how leaders 
and their groups fulfil the 
BITE Model. A more detailed 
look at the BITE Model can be found at the 
following link. We are very happy we can 
see us not as a cult:
https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/

------------

Many people think of mind 
control as an ambiguous, 
mystical process that cannot 
be defined in concrete terms. 
In reality, mind control 
refers to a specific set of 
methods and techniques, such 
as hypnosis or thought- 
stopping, that influence how a 
person thinks, feels, and 
acts.

Based on research and theory 
by Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret 
Singer, Edgar Schein, Louis 
Jolyon West, and others who 
studied brainwashing in Maoist 
China as well as cognitive 
dissonance theory by Leon 
Festinger, Steven Hassan 
developed the BITE Model to 
describe the specific methods 
that cults use to recruit and 
maintain control over people. 
“BITE” stands for Behavior, 
Information, Thought, and 
Emotional control.

---------------



There is not a leader or there are 
not any ways that Terra Joulle 
asks something from someone of the

group. Terra Joulle never did 
that and also will never do that. 
We did not collect any money 
from nobody. The income of 
Terra Joulle over the last 6 
years is 0 euro. We are not here 
for the money. We are here to 
help humans and the earth.

Based on this last explanation of 
Wikipedia we can say we are 
not a cult. Terra Joulle is 
officially registered as a 
religion because that is 
a requirement of the law.


I am happy that Terra Joulle 
Does not have nobody that is 
""Important.""
There is not a person that says 
they are special or that people 
must follow them.
Terra Joulle does not have any people 
you must follow. You must 
learn and believe in following 
yourself. The only thing we do 
is share a lifestyle. A way 
of living that can make it 
easier for you to complete 
this life. We do not ask for 
money, any materialism, love 
or anything else.
We just want to share our 
knowledge. The Terra is 
created by many people.
Never will there be a person 
or persons that will call themselves important.

The Triangle is a group that 
has followed the terra for years. 
They meditate and philosoph 
with each other a lot. They 
bring a lot new wisdom that 
they share so others can 
philosophate about it. The 
Triangle is not special. It is 
just a group of people that 
follow the Terra entirely. 
Nobody will know who this 
group is. Everyone can reach 
that state they have in the 
Triangle. You only need to 
want to live that life.

Terra Joulle have no people or 
gods you need to follow. We 
learn to believe in our 
own choices that makes your 
live. Only you can make your 
life how you want it."
cults,k2tpot,Hi all. I hope you are all doing great. With my podcast on cults this week I interview an ex member of the Philadelphia Church of God. Here is the link for those interested.,
cults,k2sdu7,About GPA (generation peace academy),"I was just approached by a young Asian girl about buying 3D prints of animals at target. I was initially skeptical when I saw her previously talking to other people who either said they couldn’t or actually bought or donated something. She eventually came to me and was friendly and was talking about how her school needed donations for essentials and stuff so being an idiot I donated the bare minimum since I didn’t want to a 3D print for $25. 

I didn’t know what this was until I got home and had a feeling of “maybe I shouldn’t have donated”. I googled it and it came up with a school website and was like “oh okay maybe I’m fine” until I got to the Reddit posts about it being a Moonie thing— I hate to say that I donated $10 but should I be worried? I called my back and they said I have to wait until it isn’t a pending transaction to dispute it. If they try to take more then I will dispute it or at least my bank will catch it before it goes through. I’m kinda freaked out since I don’t know what will happen. I feel bad for the girl for falling into something like this... I guess from one Asian woman to another but again is this something I’ll have to worry about?"

[Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/k28dib/transplanted_introduction/)

This is episode 1 of a series called “*Transplanted*.”

Synopsis: Born into an American judeo-christian cult in the late 20th century,[ /u/MandelaNuke](https://www.reddit.com/u/MandelaNuke/) must discover the truth about his home, family, life, and world before it is too late!

This is the story of my escape which began 15 years ago, and the period of recovery which followed, down to the present day. My narrative focuses on my inner state of consciousness through the process, which was my North Star guiding me through the darkness.

# Episode 1

Call me /u/MandelaNuke.

I’m a software engineer.

I live on land once stolen from the Ohlone people of California. I was born here, to citizens of the government which originally stole it.

That’s my truth, take it or leave it.

Eccentric? Perhaps, but I do have my reasons.

Stick around, because I’m about to tell you a story. If you’ll sit a spell and oblige me, I think my reasons will become clear to you in time. I offer the story of how and why I broke chains which had been put upon my own mind, since birth, by a cult, through my own family and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

|“...truth will set you free.” John 8:32|
|:-|


&amp;#x200B;

When I was born, a warm dry blanket was prepared ahead of time to bundle me up. Warm maternal arms were present to cradle me. An empty crib had already been allocated for me to sleep in. A suburban single-family home was already hosting a nursery for that crib. A sunny California town had already been built and maintained around that home, plumbing, heating, and supplies all functional. Everything was arranged for my arrival.

It really seemed as if I belonged here.

Naturally, it wasn’t only I who was given this royal treatment! I was but one of dozens of births that took place that day in my metropolitan area. We were the next generation. We had been conceived and delivered into this world by people who we did not yet understand, and our time to begin understanding had come.

But I was just a baby.

I didn’t know how it had happened, but by some miracle, this world had everything I needed. I didn’t need to wonder how it had come to be. I didn’t know the trouble of smallpox, or fording a river in a covered wagon. I didn’t need to. I was just a baby, and I was in a world of seeming abundance.

And so, I met my new father and mother fresh-faced and pure.

But they were already in the embrace of a cult which fancied my young flesh for its own ends.

Thank you for reading. In episode 2, you will meet my parents as I met them."

Like 3 months ago my mum told me I was going to a ‘camp’ for teens. My mom heard about this from a blog on tumblr, (I’ve tried looking for it but with no success) and she said that it looked like a great opportunity to develop skills and my social anxiety. 


So, 4 weeks later, the half term holidays had started and it was time to go to this ‘camp’. We arrive at the old dilapidated campsite with 3 sets of wooden cabins on one side. The Camp leader who I will refer to as ‘Bill’ said that we need to disclose of our electronic devices and anything that would link us to our homes. Bare in mind our parents were still there, and allowing this to happen.


My mom said not to worry as the ‘Holiness’ was going to guide us.

Later, I was talking with the other children about how they found this camp.
They all said they found it off a tumblr page as-well. 

If anyone could find the tumblr page it would be great.
I think there name is the ‘cult of day’ or something.



PS: I’m only 15 and very bad at grammar. 

PSS: I later escaped the ‘camp’ and went to live with my uncle’s."

Welcome to my episodic true story,""*Transplanted*.""

Synopsis: Born into an American judeo-christian cult in the late 20th century, /u/MandelaNuke must discover the truth about his home, family, life, and world before it is too late!

This is the story of my escape which began 15 years ago, and the period of recovery which followed, down to the present day. My narrative focuses on my inner state of consciousness through the process, which was my North Star guiding me through the darkness.

I thought this might be of interest to others.

Chapter 1 will appear on this subreddit soon."

cults,k0tcc2,How to Create a Cultish Conspiracy Theory,
cults,k0phe7,Short Memoir of a Landmark Graduate.,"I stopped participating after 4 years of continual Participation. Completed: Landmark Forum, Advanced Course, Self Expression Leadership Program, Communications Access to Power, Communications Power to Create, 3-5 seminars (lost track of names), Introduction Leader Program (candidated and was an IL for 3 years), Coached on 2 Introduction Leader Programs, Coached on 1 Self Expression Leadership Program, Head Coached on 1 Self-expression Leadership Program, Participated as an Introduction Leader for Young People, Assisted in at least 5 Landmark Forum weekends, Home Introduction Coach, and there's more but I will stop here. 

The following are experiences from my participation:

1. Staff members find it acceptable to call me 10 times a day every now and then (1-4 times a month). They see that I am super enthusiastic and eager to learn so they give me opportunities. When I say I have no time, they say, be 'unreasonable' which is code for 'do more than you think you can so you can grow yourself'. However, I never heard the staff say to me, ""take care of yourself, make time for yourself."" *There is such as a thing as overbooking a volunteer. Which to them, is not possible because the volunteering capacity of a person should be unlimited.* 
2. Centre Manager bullying staff members when they do not complete a task. The Bullying at landmark I experienced and witness was about saying things like: ""you have no integrity, no wonder your life does not work! You are solely responsible for this and you did not do what was necessary. You didn't break through your obstacles to achieve this task! You are being a mouse and I think you're a big person so I will not accept that. "" *There is such a thing as being a relentless coach and offering little to no compassion or even composure where someone might experience humiliation in front of other workers.* During the time that this manager was working, the growth of the company in that centre actually diminished such that their programs had to be reduced by 30% because courses were not filled up.
3. One of the senior seminar leaders stealthed my friend. She engaged in sexual intercourse with him and he removed his condom without telling her. He was fired when she reported it. It was still an awful experience. It was a form of sexual assault. I actually had a lot of respect for him. I thought he authentically wanted to make peoples lives better, in the 10 years he was a Seminar Leader. Until I heard how he lied about his achievements. Then sexually manipulated my friend and heart her immensely. 
4. My friendship with a seminar leader apprentice is one of the biggest mistakes I regret making. I thought she was inspirational and courageous because of her overcoming poverty to be the financial provider for her family despite family members dying. I thought she was intelligent and had wisdom I could learn from by spending time with her. She probably is all that. Additionally, she was selfish. I will not share explicitly what she did to me. The consequence was that I cried and cried, and felt as heartbroken as if she had tied me up, beaten me, and told me that love hurts and that's just how our relationship is and it is all my fault. 
5. Several participants, with the intention of providing valuable coaching, were actually threatening me. They were inexperienced and recited coaching and distinctions that were inappropriate. For example: ""your brother does not want to do the Forum, are you going to let that happen? His life is a mess and you are going to just sit by and watch him? This other person met a random person at a cafe and that guy ended up doing these programs and turned his life around after leaving prison. You should be brave and invite everybody!"" *There is such a thing as forcing miracles by modelling other peoples actions and behaviours hoping to reproduce miracles to feel good about yourself versus allowing things to occur organically.* Some people did go too far with this and it borderline breaching consent. 
6. There was one staff member that was miserable in the 4 years I knew her. She was unhappy that she was overweight, divorced her husband because of selfish reasons, and 'failing' at work. Side note: 80% of the staff were overweight (this is not a criticism of people's weight, this is a criticism that they set the goal of being healthy and do not set that example). She got the most 'coaching' from the seminar leader. She would smile, but I couldn't help but feel unhappy for her. She wanted to cause miracles and give gold coaching to people. She encouraged me to fulfil my potential, even if it included dropping out of university where I was at 85% completion because maybe working for landmark was a better choice to change the world for the better. And I did. I dropped out, then did not qualify for the position because as soon as I dropped out, I skipped a day of volunteering because I was so burnt out I could not leave my house. The centre manager proceeded to tell me that I 'lacked integrity' and that was a deal-breaker. I lost my job offer, but if I continued to volunteer and prove my worth and mend my integrity then there is still hope. I tried that for 6 months and then realised I wanted to finish my degree. As soon as I returned to my degree, apparently, my volunteering performance was good again and I was offered the job again. I did not accept it. They had good intentions. Just no competence and consistency. 
7. Setting the example: for a long time, I thought if I could copy the leaders at the landmark, I can full on that dream of becoming a better person. I put in time and effort. I really wanted that chance to thrive in life. After 4 years, the people that I thought were great, did not set the kind of example I wanted to follow. The lives they lived were the lives I did not want. There were people who said their marriage was great, then divorced. People who wanted to find true love then changed their mind and broke up. People who were unwell, unhealthy and overweight and chose not to do something about it. People who lied about their accomplishments. People who tout about inspiring others and helping others but hide their success methods. These people were not examples of **Living an Extraordinary Life and redefining what is possible. I did not want to be like them.** 
8. A senior seminar leader really messed up when a participant of his course said: I need to attend a funeral therefore I cannot be at your seminar classroom. He said: you have no integrity

I think that's enough. I thought I had found the arena of Spartans equivalent to success. Instead, I found humans. Doing their best, failing, and succeeding. Although their illusion to grandeur and inability to edit their behaviour was detrimental to my experience. I can't say I didn't learn much. I can't say I would wish this experience upon another. I will give thanks to those who shed light into my life. The generous, kind, supportive human beings that I am proud to have met."
cults,k0nde7,Does leaving a cult ever get any easier?,"Hey! I am 22F and around a year ago I left a cult I'd been in for around eight years. I'm not comfortable sharing the name of the cult, due to the fact that it is a small church locally and if I shared the name they would surely know who I am. I am so far one of the only people who have left, and I'm not out of the woods yet. None of my friends have ever been in a cult or have ever really left religion. Is anyone else going through this? This is the hardest thing I've done by far, and while I thought it was going to be easier by now, it is not. Does it ever get any easier?"

cults,k00kp6,New Rule: The Great Disappointment | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO),
cults,jzwhs2,The Vow (NXIVM)," It’s now concerning me that it did, but The Vow seemed reasonable at first. 

One the entrants the sex cult, as it turns out to be, says “my parents were therapists, tell me something I dont already know.” I have a therapist parent too, and regularly spout the “tell me something I don’t know” bullshit. I.e. I have a rough grip on pop psychology, and the missteps of the “power of positive thinking” world. 

I was watching this with the other half of my family, and we were all going “Jesus Christ these people are insane?!” 

After about half an episode I had to confess. As much of a cult as this clearly seemed to be, I hadn’t heard anything that sounded overtly sinister yet. We hadn’t gotten to the dark shit . 

I think it speaks to how easy it is to roll a shit in glitter, and convince kind and well intentioned, but lost people that the glittery shit is therefore magical. 

It's scary how easy it clearly is to co-opt wellness buzzwords for the opposite purpose, whatever the fuck wellness is in the first place. The scarier was, for me, that I’ve thought very similar things to them.

Your experience of life *is* largely a projection of your own emotions, and the people around you picking up on them, and vice versa. 

Fear *does* hold you back. 

BUT, as one of the escapees rightly says “if you’re in the middle of the road and there’s a truck coming towards you, being scared is the right reaction.” 

I suppose that’s my point. If you didn’t know he was one, everything the cult leader says sounds more or less logical. \*On the surface of things\*. But to run a movement/ cult/ business on the basis that there’s a perfect version of ourselves that we’re too afraid to unleash on the world, and that the problem with the world is that you allow it to make you anything but joyful, is fucking insane. 

That’s leaving aside the fact that these were all clearly middle class millennials, the vast majority of whom are white. If you’re only reference point for negative emotions is that they’re the thing holding you back in a job interview, then the sickly sweet American optimism is kinda inevitable.

You’re meant to sit there lapping up the entertainment of a cult documentary thinking “Wow these people are idiots” though, so I know I’m not saying anything noteworthy here. 

I’m not an expert on cults… but I’ve also seen Wild Wild Country, so I am. The head fuck of NXIVM is that it seems like they’re making sense, and then you put the sentences in context and blam, its a sex cult. 

My question is, is the positive thinking bullshit an excuse for people to make themselves superior, by telling people they’re inferior for not having the mental attitude of a besotted crackhead? Or, is it all completely meaningless? OR, thirdly, is it the boss with probably a very high IQ (high enough to pull the wool over everyones eyes at least) and the definitely teeny tiny dick, just using words that he knows preachy douchebags are gonna be all over in order to do his sketchy awful shit?

I don't really have a perspective of what the Mormon church looks like to outsiders. My entire family is Mormon except the estranged members that we never talked to who left the church. When I say I am deeply tied to this church, I mean that I am literally, ironically, disgustingly related to Joseph Smith on BOTH sides of my family. So for me, this organization  was the only real thing I was ever part of and I truly believed it was all true. I'm fighting this programming day in and day out, and I feel like hearing some perspectives of how this cult appears to an outsider may help me continue fighting this war inside my mind."

cults,jzi2lq,I need your help,"Ok guys so I was recently apart of a mental wellness company, which you can message me if you would like the name as I am worried I will be targeted.

On the surface it was supposed to be a mental resource and safe community for people to come in, use our app, express their issues, and get the help an every day person would need.

But I learned that it was far from helping anyone.

Our “leader” would come to us with “messages she received from the likes of robin Williams, prince, Michael Jackson, Kurt cobain, Kobe Bryant, etc. and she would allow these messages to guide whatever decision she would make. Her “spirit guides held the codes for the 12d matrix” 

She would constantly be telling us to slow down and look within, even if we were doing perfectly fine, she would create something in you that felt like you were wrong, or somethin was wrong with you.

She also would take personal experiences of trauma and anxiety and tell you that if you are feeling those feelings then you “aren’t doing the word you need to level up your vibration”

This woman believes that she has been sent here to liberate souls from intergalactic trauma, and she uses people’s beliefs against them in order to gain control over them.

She once
Told us all that her daughter (which has been observed to be autistic) acts the way she does because she has been “intergalactically” sex trafficked in 17 passed lives.

This has nothing to do with the wellbeing of an every day person and was extremely frightening to hear that coming from someone I thought I could
Maybe trust....

Everything behind the scenes of this company is an obvious cult in the making.

I was terminated for this exact reason that cake out of the founders mouth

“The company has made a timeline jump, and its with a heavy heavy heart that I inform you that your vibration isn’t aligned with the energetic jump
The company made”

This was absolutely not based on any quality of work I would do, which was social
Media marketing, newsletters, and graphics. 

This was a personal attack on my “vibration”

I was tricked into allowing myself to be put under this woman’s spell and I believe she is truly dangerous. 

I desperately need some assistance in making sure nobody else falls victim to this.


She took things like meditation, sacred experience, real life shit,

And manipulated it in her way to make herself more powerful, she took practices I already had in place and made them feel unsafe.

I really need help getting the word out if anyone knows a safe way to do so. Thank you."

cults,jzhgdh,How to help a closeted LGBT+ Mormon? Reposting here because Mormonism is a cult.," Reposted from r/exmormon

I didn't know where else I could get advice, so here I am. I guess I'll start with some backstory. My (20f) best friend (20f) of 8 years was raised in a very strict military Mormon family. We met when we were 12, and from the moment I met her, I knew her as an independent, free thinker who sprinkled as much rebellion as she could into her life. This is a huge part of why we were inseparable for so long. I would go to her church's youth group with her every Wednesday for years, and she and I always went off and got up to some mischief, never focusing much on the religious aspect and just enjoying each others company. I even went to the Mormon girls summer camp with her for a couple years. Now, I am not Mormon (am Wiccan) and I witnessed firsthand how weird her church was, though a lot of it didn't click until I got older. I never worried much about her religious stance because she always has accepted me the way I am, and she always questioned things for herself. Since her family was so strict that her parents often treated their 3 kids like they were in the military too, she often got stressed out about her home life and would vent to me about how she felt pressured to be a certain way by everyone around her, sometimes in tears. I was always there for her, but never worried too much because she always did what she wanted anyways. Looking back, it was always very obvious that she is a lesbian. She was always extremely snuggly and affectionate with girls, including me. There was something between us when we were like 14, mainly initiated by her, but it was stomped out quickly. Her first kiss was a girl. She was my first girl crush, which made me realize I do like girls a bit as well. She hardly dated at all, but it was always a guy.

Fast forward to 3 years ago, her family decided to move across the country (US west to east coast, so very far). Once she moved, it was more difficult to maintain our friendship and we drifted apart more. I had a boyfriend, and she started secretly seeing some mid 20's military vet she met in an RV park, to whom she lost her virginity. Around that point, she started caring about church more. Around mid 2019, she calls me one night and says she decided to go on a mission. She and I didn't talk nearly as much as we used to anymore, but it still seemed really weird, especially since it isn't necessary for girls to go. She said she went to a meeting one night and decided she wanted to go. I questioned it, since she has ALWAYS been extremely impulsive, but she insisted it was the right thing for her. My boyfriend (who she really likes btw) and I took a long road trip out there to see her and see if anything was up, but it was really awkward and we ended up leaving after only 3 days. Then she left. I was shocked she actually went.

And true to her impulsive character, she didn't stay for the whole mission because she didn't feel like it anymore, and she went home. That was back in April. She called me one day to say she was back (I was shocked again) and she told me and my bf to move across the country to move into an apartment with her. We said no, because we are already moving with my family soon, and also the pandemic and so and so. I hadn't talked to her at all the entire time she was on her mission (9 or so months) and I didn't know what to say to her, so we hardly talk anymore.

A couple months ago, she texts me one day that she got a boyfriend. I'm like ""wow that's awesome, I'm glad you're happy with him!"" and blah blah blah. The VERY NEXT DAY, she texts me to say they're getting married. Instantly, I'm like... wtf. In all the years I knew her, she was always the ""independent I-don't-need-no-man"" type, so she was the last one of our friends I expected to ever settle down and get married, let alone at 20. I told my mom, who knew and loved her, and she was super weirded out. I asked my friend how long she's even been with this guy---- 4 months. I start prying, asking if she's sure, and if she's okay, if something happened, all the like. All I got out of her was that ""she loves him, she is sure about it, and he is great to her."" I figured that since I don't know her much anymore, I should look past it and respect it and move on.

Today she texts me, saying she's going on a solo road trip early next year and she wants to see me and my family in the place we're moving to early next year. Of course I was happy about that. She elaborates that she wants to live out of her car for a bit and reflect on herself. I ask her if she's still getting married, as she told me that she'd be marrying that guy this month. She said she doesn't know, and then she came out to me. Honestly, it all made sense, I mean, growing up, I thought she was at the very least bisexual. This was the first thing she said that made sense to me since she moved away from our town. She explained, and in short, she realized she was a lesbian on her mission, and since being gay is so bad, she basically has been trying to ""pray the gay away."" She went home, went on a date with a guy who had a crush on her for like 2 years, and immediately disclosed that she is experiencing same-sex attraction, and I guess that didn't matter to this guy. They got together, he got babtized into the the Mormon church, they decided to get married, and now she is very understandably getting cold feet and is contemplating leaving him.

This is the part where I need advice. So basically, my friend grew up in a very strict structured house and religion. There have always been rules and people around her to use as a crutch, and she is a very impulsive, erratic, and non committal person. When she has no structure or people telling her what to do, she doesn't really seem to know what direction to take and ends up doing something crazy. When she moved away from all her friends, graduated high school and had to decide what to do with her life, she got lost in the vastness of everything and ended up using her religion as a crutch. As I'm sure plenty of you know, Mormonism is a cult. To this day, Mormonism is the only consistent, stable thing in her life. Everything else, she has either quit, changed her mind, or drifted away from. I feel I am also at fault for this because I am the only person who has consistently been her friend all these years and I have not been making an effort in our friendship these last couple years because she got all religious and her church freaks me out a bit. Anyways, she realized she was gay, and her church says that's bad, so she tried to force herself into a heterosexual relationship, and that is not working out. She truly does believe her in her religion, and says she has had some significant experiences with God, and she is lost on whether or not to ""defy God or defy herself,"" as she put it. I am worried about her. The last 3 years of our friendship have been weird and this is the first glimmer I've seen of the person I knew in a loooong time. She says she wants to transfer to a Mormon college in Utah and ask her peers for advice and help there. I fear that that will not go very well for her.

Has anyone had any experiences similar to this? Any ex Mormons who struggled with their sexuality? What can I do to help her, if anything at all? While Mormonism is culty and very off-putting to me, my goal isn't to drag her away from her relationship with God, even though I have very different beliefs, it is just to help her accept herself, to get on her feet and find a path in life where she doesn't have to rely on others telling her what is okay or not okay. Though I will admit, if she leaves her sketchy butt cult religion, I would certainly not be complaining. If you read all this, thank you so much!"

I watched, scrolled through, and a few videos later, saw a different young guy with the same story. So of course it piqued my interest. I clicked, watched all of the videos, only to discover there is a 3rd one also involved. Posts only from the last few days, at least 2 of them talk about their music being available. But seems legit, googled the dad of all of the kids/leader, Winston Blackmore, first I have heard of him. But looks like these 3 are about to fill open about it all on TikTok.

The dad dressed like “Jesus” hair and everything and called himself the messiah and we went to meetings in some building with a bunch of fold up chairs every week, he seemed to be the leader. His kids were pretty strange too, one of his daughters said something about if a “hobo wanted to have sex with you” and her “thinking it would feel good..” and I remember being pretty creeped out when we met on Halloween too.

cults,jxucfa,Don't Go to the Meadows Rehab at Wickenberg! It is a Cult!,"Hello all.  I am writing from a randomly generated reddit profile to tell my story, partly so I can let it go, but also to warn others from potentially going to this rehab and becoming part of the cult.  I do not use social media as a rule, but I will check back here periodically in case a conversation is going.  I don't plan to use this reddit profile otherwise.

I am a 34 year old man married man, with a 1 year old in the home.  In February of this year I got a DUI.  My parents sent me to a rehab, in this case the Meadows in Wickenberg, partly for legal reasons but also to get some help with my mental health.

I want to warn anyone who sees this that the Meadows is a cult.  It may be the case that ALL rehabs are cults, I cannot speak on that though.  

The Meadows is a cult.  Before your discharge date you will be forced to fill out a Meadows written discharge after care form.  Part of this is making an appointment (with a Meadows employee outside listening) with a therapist in the outside world certified to teach the Meadows program.  Think that is creepy, I am just getting started.

The Meadows touts itself as a substance abuse and trauma rehab.  Regardless of what you are coming to the rehab for, your program will cover both trauma and substance abuse.  You have no choice on the matter.  The Meadows teaches that all substance abuse is linked to trauma so you will study both.

Now that I have given an overview, I will go over my experience chronologically, pointing out cult activity borrowed from other cults.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I flew in to Phoenix from out of state.  Upon arriving, I received a call from my driver (yes, you will be brought to the rehab by a certified driver.  They do not trust anyone to come to the facility on their own.)  I told him I would meet him at baggage claim.  He then called me again as I was still walking to  baggage claim (it isn't a huge airport, but this was maybe two minutes later).  I did NOT pick up, partly out of frustration at being checked on literally a few minutes after I got off the phone with him, partly out of rebellion, and partly to identify my driver.  I subtly identified him out of the corner of my eye, spotting him with his phone to his ear.  Out of rebellion I then went to baggage claim on my own, grabbed my bag, then went back up the escalator to meet up with him.  He was obviously taken aback.  

They are supposed to watch you with your luggage, but I thought this was bogus.  What was I going to do.  I had to go to rehab for court.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At this point, I would like to say that it is best to stay out of court if you can.  Get your lawyer to find away to stay out of court.  Then, if you do go to a rehab, make your after care arrangements as vague as possible.  I made mine meditation and AA.  You can argue against going to AA in court later (using your 1st amendment right).  I have not picked up a drink since my DUI in February, WITHOUT any form of aftercare, including AA.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I then ""enjoyed"" the thirty minute ride to the Meadows.  You might as well enjoy the drive, as your freedom is gone as soon as you get to rehab.

Upon arriving at the rehab doors you are no longer a human being, you are an addict.  I do not identify as an alcoholic.  As I said, I have not had a drink since February, without any help.  Regardless, you are given a thorough physical and mental exam upon arriving.

You are then led to your room, which you share with a roommate.  

There is no privacy at the Meadows.  While many people do find ways to get some on the grounds, either by studying in their room, or outside in the gardens, the only way to have private thoughts is to buy a journal in the book store and write them down.

Which brings me to the book store.  Everything is thoroughly (or not so thoroughly) vetted in the book store to Meadows approved books.  There is no fiction sold at the bookstore.  All novels you brought with you are confiscated upon arrival at the Meadows, and returned only when you leave at the door.

The idea is that you spend all your time at the Meadows thinking about ""therapy"" 24/7, for the six weeks you are here.

I put thoroughly vetted in quotes because Buddhist books are included, and anyone who has studied Buddhism knows that Buddhism philosophy does not believe in recovery.  ""Addiction"" is a symptom of a deeper problem of craving, that is remedied, like everything else, through mindfulness training.

Regardless, you can find books from Pema Chodron and Thic Nhat Hanh in the bookstore.  I advise buying these books and reading them, IF ONLY to avoid groupthink.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

You don't have any ""sessions"" on your first day.  You are allowed your first 12 hours to get used to your new surroundings.  With no access to the outside world; no cell phone, no tv for the first three days; you have no choice but to absorb the doctrine.  And they will break you down.

Your only session is with your primary therapist on your first day, who swiftly gets to the task of breaking you down.  He or she will ask about you, but only the bad things you have done.  The questions are only about your ""addiction"" and the bad things you have done towards yourself and others.  No questions are asked about who you actually are.  That doesn't matter.  You then are identified as an alcoholic, an addict, OR if you have no substance abuse issue, you are given a psychological label of codependent, etc.

Now, with your new label, you can be indoctrinated into who you ""really are"", so they can fix it.

The job of your primary is to be your best friend/ but also your worst enemy.  He or she will break you down, but then ""lift you up"" in recovery.

""It isn't really your fault"", after all.  You have a disease (even without any substance use) and you need help.  It was ""the world"" that did this to you through ""abuse"".  It was other people.

You are forced to go to 12 step meetings, where you receive indoctrination through the 12 steps.  This is rounded up and combined with the Meadows method, however.

Not only are you an alcoholic/addict, but you are also codependent, and perhaps have a personality disorder.

If staff can't define you with a personality disorder, they can always make one up.  Love addict/love avoidant is Pia Mellody (the guru and founder of the Meadows) chosen personality disorder.

It does not exist as a disorder outside of Meadows rehabs.  Basically, even your own romantic partner is bad for you.  Nothing is sacred or healthy in your life.  Even your significant other should be weighed and judged.

If you have a problem with drinking it must be because you are in a bad marriage.  There couldn't be any other reason: you have built up a habit of drinking over time that has become compulsive, you like drinking alcohol...

Now that even your spouse has been stripped away from you they have you where they want you.

They build you back up.

You will go to the Survivors Program, where you will talk about childhood abuse you suffered (even if there was none.)

I want to take a moment here to say that Pia Mellody defines abuse as anything ""less than loving or nurturing.""  By this definition, a glance or look from your Mom or Dad, during a moment of frustration or anger is abuse.

A remark, no matter how infrequent, is abuse.  It doesn't matter if your Mom or Dad meant it or not, whether it was what they actually thought or just an unthinking moment of frustration.

YOU WERE ABUSED!!!

Let me say that as a parent who loves his kid, he nonetheless DRIVES ME CRAZY!  Because I love him, and he is getting old enough to interpret language and expressions now, I try not to show any frustration to him.  But occasionally frustration leaks out.  It does not mean I don't love him or don't care about him.  It means that toddlers can be annoying as fuck.  You still love them though.

Abuse is an active attempt to undermine another person's wellbeing.  Not a fricken remark made out of anger, occassional and lacking truth?

Anyway!  

Now you are taught to build boundaries.  Now don't get me wrong, boundaries are good to have and are vital to wellbeing.  But they should be common sense boundaries.

At the Meadows, you are taught that parents and spouses are dangerous and out to get you.  So you need to defend against such things as:

* Differences of opinion
* any and all criticism (you are, after all, a God)
* any input on how you are behaving as a spouse, family member, etc.

Now with your walls against society, you are free to leave.

But remember that you must still go to AA and go to a Meadows certified counselor, because you have a disease and will never be cured.

Thanks for the $60,000."
cults,jxtwze,Cults and Cancer?,"Not to get too tin-foil hatty here...but what is the DEAL with cults and people dying from cancer. In NXIVM we see several high ranking members die of cancer. Watching Leah Remini's Aftermath and it seems like damn near everyone in scientology dies of cancer (if not suicide). 

On the scientology side, I am wondering if the force labor of Sea Org simply exposed people to asbestos and other toxins on a daily basis for decades. 

Would love to see if statistically Sea Org members have a higher rate of cancer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking out loud, maybe its not a high rate but because they reject treatment they have a higher death rate."

The story was produced by women and focused on the women who were victims of the cult. It very much focused on telling their story and empowering them.

Last night I started watching *The Vow* and after 2 episodes I am very upset with it. It focuses heavily on one man, a filmmaker, who was essentially the right-hand man to the cult leader. So while people were getting branded, raped, and brainwashed in this cult, this guy was busy filming and recording everything. He was very high up in the organization and so must have been complicit in the abuse, in some way. 

Then, when the whole thing blew up, he packed up his footage and created a 2 season documentary that (so far) seems to focus a lot on him and puts him in a good light. 

I could be totally wrong, but I really get the impression that this guy was complicit in the abuse and is now cashing in on it.

Have you seen the full documentary? Am I wrong? I'd like to watched *Seduced* which I read might be a better documentary about the same subject."

There was online church meetings and everything, but something I noticed when I looked at it a bit more was 1) There is a rule that you are allowed to lie to non-members to get them to join and 2) According to my friend, who used to be in it, there was lots of violent threats from members of the religion. I looked at the BITE model, but I couldn't find enough information on the religion itself. I also don't know if it's large enough to be considered a cult.

cults,jwx41e,Trapped in a word faith cult,"My family and I need some advice/help. I was raised (and am now stuck) in a religious word of faith cult and we don’t know how to go about getting out. Our situation is crazy...Our entire life is controlled, we live on church property in a house that belongs to the church, I have a position in “ministry” so I am paid a weekly salary and have been told numerous times not to work an outside job because the “church” needs me at our 4 services each week. How we spend our money is controlled...We aren’t allowed to have protein shakes, energy drinks, or herbal supplements, my husband has Cancer and isn’t able to work right now and we are told on a regular basis that he hasn’t received his healing from God because our faith isn’t strong enough due to sin and smoking cigarettes...we are all expected to run, jump , shout JESUS, dance, roll on the floor, laugh and laugh, you name it...and basically act like crazy people during our church services, and if we aren’t doing those things and shouting him down while he’s preaching, then we are berated and made to feel guilty, like we just don’t love God like we should..we aren’t allowed to speak anything negative...my husband can’t speak that he has Cancer because by doing so he is speaking it on himself. So we constantly have to “break” every negative word we speak. If you have COVID you can’t say you have COVID because you are cursing yourself. We are supposed to claim and receive the things we want in Jesus name and we will get them...but when we DONT receive those things, it’s due to our lack of faith. He constantly berates and verbally abuses the congregation when we aren’t acting the way he thinks we should during service and he blames the lack of growth in the church on the members. He has repeatedly said he can’t think of any sin he has in his life...they use money as the primary form of control (buying members brand new vehicles and houses, cash “blessings”,) and its not just us, we are just worse off than others for a couple different reasons...we will be on the streets with our child if we speak up about anything going on...they pit members against each other so there’s constant bickering, fighting, and gossiping going on...people are always telling on each other to the pastor for things they think he wouldn’t approve of, then we get an hour bashing during his “preaching” because “God shows him people’s sins”...No one can challenge him or question him or it’s hell to pay...He has so many people on payroll...and this is their only source of income, he frequently “tests” people to see how strong their faith is and if they’re coming for the “right reasons” by, as he says it, “Cutting people off.” That’s right. He gets some sick pleasure out of taking away people’s only source of income with no warning, reason, nothing...it can last from weeks to months...Then all of a sudden you’re handed a check and it starts all over again. There is just so much more, I could go on and on about his theology, mind control tactics he uses, etc. BUT I won’t...now, here’s the fucked up part...THE CULT LEADER IS MY DAD!!! I feel like I am losing my mind, and I don’t know how much more I can take. I have lost 60 lbs in the past year due to not eating because of stress, anxiety, and severe depression.

It was completely crowded.  One side of the sign said something about souls being harvested from this site, and awaiting “their” return.  The other side of the sign talked about anti-capitalism.

It was interesting with how much time I've spent studying the People's Temple and other collective groups, I still wanted to join. They could tell I worked outside and spoke of their wood shops and farms, which was made all the more impressive because they had built the inside of the restaurant and it was awesome.

 My mother, her former husband, and my half-siblings lived in Santa Barbara in the 70s (first on Mission Ridge and then in a hippy community, Banana Road). They were in the Children of Light cult, affiliated to the ""I AM"" cult of Guy Ballard ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22I\_AM%22\_Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22I_AM%22_Activity)). As far as I understand it, they believed that if they achieved a certain level of consciousness, and transmuted their bad karma, they could ascend to a higher level after leaving this plane (death), as well as other things like communicating with higher beings called the ascended masters. 

They had various techniques for achieving consciousness, that my unfortunate siblings experienced through no choice of their own.  As far as I know, a bunch of  power struggles went down in this Santa Barbara branch of ""I AM"" between the group's leader, Esther, and a woman named Helen from Huntsville, Alabama, and led to my family leaving the area and eventually leaving the US altogether (I was born much later in Europe).

I'd love to connect anyone who knows anything at all about the Children of Light or the people involved in it.   It'd be a big help to me in understanding my mother better (she's now dead), how she was indoctrinated, and how that affected us kids. Thanks for reading."

I am a little obsessed with cults that meet a violent end and their connection to commonly shared concerns about the end of the world (nuclear war, race wars, environmental destruction etc)

I watched a single documentary that claimed Luc Jouret was obsessed with nuclear war. This fact would corroborate my theories about certain psychological connections. But I can't find any primary evidence that Luc Jouret preached about the dangers of nuclear weapons."

cults,jvrmbd,Cult similar to NXIVM?,"I just watched The Vow and was reminded of a Twitter thread that I had seen about a year ago from a woman who had left a cult. I don't remember much but the details that I do remember are incredibly similar to the details of the NXIVM saga. I know that I'm not just thinking of NXIVM because at the time Keith Raniere had already been sentenced, whereas the cult I was reading about was still incredibly active and its leaders had been posting on Instagram, and was also much smaller and not as widely known.

Here's what I remember:

* It's run by a couple, but the man was more in charge. Both of them have sexual relationships with the other members.
* The leaders go by weird code names and would give members new names.
* The leaders are incredibly 'alt' - piercings, tattoos, strange hairstyles. They're pretty young - definitely not middle-aged yet.
* The cult is very new and very small. Definitely not established enough for anyone to have been born into it.
* There are two layers to the cult: A front-facing one that is ostensibly a lifestyle movement, which is a front to recruit people to the cult proper.
* The cult members basically worship the male leader and are essentially his servants. Other than that, there's no religious element.
* Everyone has to wear white all the time, but like sweatpants not robes or hoods or anything.
* The cult is very active online, especially on Instagram. There was an Instagram page dedicated to exposing them, and the leaders knew about this page and would comment on its posts.
* Whenever the cult was accused of keeping a member against their will, they would post a photo or video of that member smiling or otherwise having a good time.
* A lot of the members lived together and their diets and routines were controlled. Exercise was a big part of it!
* Members would regularly get assignments that involved posting propaganda on the internet, including commenting on the enemy Instagram's posts and denying all accusations.

That's all I can remember for now, will update if I can think of anything else."
cults,jvl8eu,"Why Are Many Vocal ""Passionate"" Fans about A Work of Fiction, Culture, Ideology, and Hobby Often Both Ignorant of Their Passions and Fair-weathered (Easily Quitting Them once They get Bored)? Despie Commonly Also Being Elitist (Often Bullies) About Their Interests When They Were Still Into Them?","A pattern I tend to notice among fandoms and subcultures. We all know how toxic and aggressive fans of anything be it Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Death Metal music, and so on can be often engaging in feuds with other rivals to their interests like DBZ VS Sailor moon, Skateboarding vs Extreme Biking, Democrats vs Republicans, etc. And so many ""fans"" are not just noisy about how they are so ""fanatical"" about their interests often to the point they can't talk about anything in public (even with strangers at the bus or the waiter at the restaurant) about their knowledge of the Vietnam War or why Friends was superior to Seinfeld and the latest Lacrosse championship cup (despite everybody else in public not really caring). Some fan(atic)s take it to a whole other level completely revolving their lives around their interests and wearing nothing but clothing endorsing socialism or spraypainting their cars with Gundam robot models or getting tatoos that are verses from the Quran in Arabic and using nothing but a New York Yankees licensed bag to carry any items (even when its impractical such as carrying heavy hiking equipment).............

What I don't understand though is despite their rabid fanaticism about gaming or The X Files and how they keep rambling on and on in public about them (even obnoxiously bothering strangers in an attempt to introduce them to their passions and arguing with fans of opposing passions in public, sometimes even getting violent)............. In a short time (like after 4 years once they graduate as seniors and start college for example) they quickly give up their passions and often never touch it again as though they were never fans. Despite spending $100 for a Neon Genesis T-Shirts or spending time at Comic-Con instead of fixing their grades at school or reading hours of Republican literature and joining the local Red Party Club (while ignoring their health is suffering from diabetes to the danger zone), it seems their ""intense love"" for their hobby is very brief and fair-weathered. For all their obnoxiousness about their interests when they were into it esp talking about it nonstop with strangers in public who don't give a damn, it seems they were never really the fans they often shouted that they proudly were who are willing to stay with their subculture till death, even die rather than giving it up.

It gets even worse how they not only start public verbal tangos with fans of rival competing interests or people hate the hobby or franchise or hell even uninterested bystanders, sometimes escalating it into physical assault, but they are often acting all aristocratic and full of elitism about it. They look down on other ""not true fans"" for not being as obsessed with said hobby (even though these fans are still pretty hardcore) and bully enthusiastic noobs ruthlessly who just joined the club out of real sincere interest in improving their level of devotion to communism to even greater levels. Often hazing what they deemed as ""traitors"" to their interests for refusing to stick with one faction but loving multiple opponents (like DC readers who also enjoy a Marvel comics equally and people who follow the hybrid Chrislam instead of solely sticking to either Christianity or Islam or moderate Republicans who support some liberal beliefs, etc)...........

All despite the fact they are the ones to quickly give up their fanaticism esp after a huge life changing event (like starting college or giving birth to a child)! While ironically the less hardcore ""not true fans"" and ""casual noobs"" and especially those ""traitors"" who see no problems with being both a World of Warcraft and EverQuest player or conceding Buffy the Vampire Slayer has huge flaws and is far inferior to Supernatural in artistic elements (despite still honestly ranking Buffy as their fav TV show) are the ones who stick through with the hobby or subculture for decades more, often onto old age or even their death! It seems like the non-vocal fans who see no problem with loving baseball and soccer or people who don't obsessively rant out in public about why Mike Tyson is Da Bestest heavyweight champion eva are the ones who are the real loyal fans!

What is the mindset behind this insane troll logic? Why do people who go out and bully strangers for not agreeing with that communism is the best ideology or preferring Game of Thrones over The Lord of the Rings(but still loving both along with Harry Potter) often the ones with the most fair-weathered devotion? While fans who have no problem being both a hardcore Star Trek and Star Wars fanatic are the ones who pull in through for the rest of their lives as seriously diehard devotees to the franchise the vocal ""passionate"" crowd obnoxiously laugh at people not as hardcore as they are the first to quickly give up their beloved subject of interests?"
cults,jvjp5n,"Cult about MLK's ""I have a dream speech"" but with aliens","I was gonna post this on r/tomt, but I didn't wanna bother them with this sort of thing 'cos you guys might know more anyhow. Also, I haven't used reddit before so if I'm doing something wrong or if I need to post elsewhere, just tell me. The bottom line is that I'm looking for this alien cultist website that was very amusing. It may not be up anymore.

My sister and I used to send each other weird shit on our school emails (2016? 2015?) and she sent me this whack website with the most retina burning web design. The owner clearly had a pension for rainbows, as the backgrounds were composed entirely of rainbow gradients and lots of paragraphs in alternating rainbow text. It was almost unreadable. It was mostly dedicated to an androgynous blonde Jesus-type fellow whose ""hug would bring you, a mere mortal, to tears"". Other fun details go as follows:

* All languages that are not Polish are ""bad vibrations"" created by evil bad guy aliens. Polish is the one true language, created by Blonde Jesus.
* There were real photos of friendly aliens hanging out with humans on their spaceships... Well, sorta? The website owner would post *paintings* of the photos instead, for unknown reasons. They were passionately made but a bit uncanny.
* There was Blonde Jesus's manifesto. It was actually just MLK's ""I have a dream"" speech, but with aliens instead of black people. Copy and pasted, word for word.
* There was a section where you could download what is essentially their bible....It was, like, thousands and thousands of pages long. I never downloaded it, but I'm at a loss for what they'd fill it with.
* The owner disliked the internet, stating ""it would bring bad vibes"". They advised that rather than email them, we should contact them via pigeon or ""good vibes"".
* The cult was impressively not racist or sexist at all. It doesn't matter who you are, as long as you speak Polish (but now that I think of it, the whole website was in English...?)

Obviously, this sounds like a joke. It has to be. It's just that this site was so densely packed with rainbow-soaked crystal palace jargon that I have to say it was completely genuine. I mean, that bible of theirs. I would very much like to find it again. This isn't a joke in the slightest.

Sadly, it might be gone as it's been awhile and the owner wasn't apparently big into the ""bad vibes"" of the internet. I would look on my school email, but since I've graduated it's been deleted.

ALSO: I remember the blonde jesus fella being named ""Alexi"" or ""Andrew"" or something with an A in it. Not anything super weird, to my surprise."

A player (who took on the form of a mushroom) told me that before this iteration, there was one where the spiders were actually cannibals. I became a spider and... did not do the cannibal thing it's completely optional (You're still you when you're a spider, not AI or anything). 

Holy water drops occasionally, and I assume you drink it to avoid becoming a spider? Nurses are *very* stingy about it, usually saying something along the lines, ""Oops! We ran out."" as they ""step"" on it and break the last bottle or ""drink"" it. 

I also found this game in my recommended.

The real fun starts with our very own Param Saint, our Sat Guru, our Living Master - Gary Olsen. Gary's (*ALLEGED*) highlight reel includes: 

**Gary and the Bird Flu:**

Here are some snippets from his May 28, 2006 tape entitled ""Master Satsangs The Bird Flu"" : ""The bodies...they’re not even gonna be able to handle the bodies""…""If you’ve ever seen a war zone I mean they just pile ‘em up""...""They even have a plan how to bury your own dead""...""If you’re in a family and some of your own go, you’re gonna wanna put ‘em in the ground. And if that happens, chances are you’re not gonna make it."" ""I’m not an alarmist and I am not an extremist, I do not exaggerate. I’m not into any of that stuff, that’s just cheap trickery."" 

""One should probably have food and water for at least 3-4 months, and even that’s gonna be risky"". ""We want long term plan and we want a short term plan. For your own information, I’m compiling together a little bird flu pamphlet. It’s being compiled right now."" ""Tom, I want that on my desk by June 21st. I’ll go over it, send it back to the office and we’ll get it out in the June mailing so you should get it in July. And whatever I have in that pamphlet there, I want you to study it and be prepared""…""Some of the things I’m gonna tell you now are not gonna be in the pamphlet."" ""So we’re gonna need food and water for at least 3 - 4 months, but if this baby goes years that’s gonna be a whole other issue."" ""You better sit down alone or with your wife or husband and come up with a plan""…""I want you to have a plan to survive. And I mean that. Everything is about survival. What you’re learning on the MasterPath is how to survive in higher dimensions""…""Can you survive in the astral plane?""... ""Now we’re talking about survival down on the physical. A lot of us are in la-la land, we’ve been treated so nicely in America""...""You talk to anyone who’s been in the holocaust and you watch their eyes light up""… ""it's serious stuff""…""anyone who’s been in war""… ""it gets heavy very, very, very fast""….""It’s gonna have the same effect"". ""The few people that can get through it are ones that have an extraordinarily strong immune systems""….""You better start beefing up your regimen""…""You wanna be conscientious about this. That seems to be your only safeguard""... ""Everyone’s at risk""...""It takes anywhere from 1-2 weeks to finish you off."" ""Food and water for 3-4 months""….""if we get into 2-3 years you’re gonna have to be thinking like 50-100 pounds of rice""...""You’re gonna have to have some way to boil your water""...""Live on water and rice""...""Very real here."" ""If you prepare for 2-3 months and it goes long term, well then you’re ill prepared."" ""They can’t guarantee the utilities will stay on. The national plan says for 50% of utility workers to stay on the job, 50% go home, and the ones that go home stay home""…""They feel the utilities will last about 2 or 3 weeks before the people working in the utilities are wiped out."" ""They also say that it’s the medical field that’s just gonna get decimated. With their humanitarian bend of mind, helping people in trouble... they’re gonna be sitting in the hospitals""…""helping the people that get sick""…""they don’t have the supplies to deal with the sick people""….""the projections are that it’s gonna wipe out the medical field...anyone that’s dumb enough to stay there.""

 ""Then Gary goes into sort of a tirade about initiate reports and how the chelas are not following his directions. Apparently they're supposed to write ""IR"" on the reports and they can only be one page. But some chelas were sending in several pages and Gary said it was no laughing matter, it is serious. ""Do you think it's not a check against you when you ignore the master's directions?"" Also Gary says, ""I know you want answers but that's like a 4 year old saying 'Daddy explain to me sexual intercourse'. The kid's way over his head. Let the kid find out himself. This is not mommy daddy. Learn to go into the works and look for your answer."" - (*Violet11 via City-Data*) : [http://www.city-data.com/forum/religion-spirituality/429080-gary-olsens-master-path-anybody-familiar-139.html](http://www.city-data.com/forum/religion-spirituality/429080-gary-olsens-master-path-anybody-familiar-139.html)  
 

**Gary Defines The Traits of a Perfect Master:** 

&gt;1. A Perfect Master lives like an ordinary citizen.  
2. He wears no special clothes, ie., robes; long flowing mantles; or turbans, which would distinguish Him from the people among whom he lives.  
3. He applies no sandlewood paste to his forehead, called a tilek, and does not smear ashes over His body, which are India's trademarks.4. He normally leads a family life, and does not hide Himself in jungles, mountains or caves, far from the public eye.  
5. He earns His own livelihood, which usually consists of hard labor with the hands. For example: Christ was a carpenter; Namdev was a tailor; Ravidas a shoemaker; Kabir a weaver; Nanak a farmer, and Gary a painting contractor.  
6. He does not accept for his own use any gifts, unless the seeker giving it will be crushedthen it is accepted, but usually, the gift is just shelved.  
7. Perfect Masters give little or no importance to temples, mosques, churches, and shrines. They carry no beads, no rosaries, and no crosses, which they consider products of ignorance, reflecting gross misrepresentations.  
8. Perfect Masters are not interested in founding new religions, or organizing sects or cults. These are usually established when the True Master leaves this world, by his disciples through ignorance, narrow mindedness, greed and lust for position and power.  
9. Perfect Masters promise no worldly wealth or successes. They give no charms and amulets or other means for worldly gain.  
10. Perfect Masters do not recall dead spirits or practice occultism. They work no miracles for public exhibition, though they may do so for the spiritual advancement of their disciples.  
11. Perfect Masters are against the use of all intoxicating drugs and drinks, and stress the need for depending on one's own spiritual forces, rather than foreign substitutes.  
12. Perfect Masters are clean from bodily odors. Their physical status is glorious, their health superb. They teach that a strong body is essential for the seeker, to withstand the rechemicalization of their constitution.  
13. A Perfect Master eats but little during the day. Usually one meal is sufficient, for their energy is acquired and transmuted from the cosmic Shabda, and this sustains their physical body, and the heavy schedule they adhere to.  
14. A Perfect Master is not concerned with large followings, notoriety, or public opinion. Those seekers that have been marked for the Light and Sound, are easily attracted to Him.  
15. A Perfect Master has learned how to move about in crowds, without stirring the least bit of suspicion, as to their position in the heirarchy \[sic\]. They are not interested in getting compliments from others, and would rather remain in the back ground. The revealing of all their power, love, and wisdom, is reserved for the inner regions, and great effort is made, to appear as anyone else would.  
16. Perfect Masters are not concerned with being recognized for what they are. Those that are drawn into their circle, have no problem or limitation in relating to, or experiencing their omnipresence, omnipotence, or omniscience.  
17. A Perfect Master always deals with Truth, and wants to be known as a channel for Truth by His followers. Those aspiring after truth, recognize this as the greatest of His qualities. He knows that it is only the Truth that will set man free, and nothing else.  
18. A Perfect Master always gives the seeker his total freedom. He never tries to own the individual, and insists that with attainment, the seeker will be released from His care. This is completely contrary to any other puesdo \[sic\] Masters objective.  
19. A Perfect Master will openly claim that He is God. He will not try and intellectually prove this point, but will guide the seeker into his own inner world, to verify this for himself.  
20. A Perfect Master will insist that if His message is taken on faith, heresay \[sic\], or through secondhand knowledge, then this knowledge is less than perfect. Personal experience is the order of a genuine Master.

**Gary describes his ideal applications of Physical Devotion:**

*""PHYSICAL DEVOTION - Phenomenal Consciousness is the outer affair experienced through the gross and subtle senses within the Pinda Egg; systematically corresponds to the chakras beneatht the Third Eye:  1) Surat Bhakti - When a chela listens to the discourses with his/her ears while in the presence of the Living Master.  2) Sparsh Bhakti - When the chela touches the Master in any way or the Master touches the chela. Devotion experienced through touch.  3) Rup Bhakti - Viewing the form of the Master with one's eyes (without blinking). Lovingly and steadily gazing at the Master's Third Eye.  4) Smell Devotion - Sensing through smell the subtle currents emanating from the Master's aura whether present or not in the physical body.  5) Pashu Bhakti - Separate level of devotion (apart from the subtle senses) which embodies all five gross elements as one. Deals with the animal nature of humans - beneath the heart center. Predominant interactions manifest in forms of arguing, debating, and quarreling with fellow souls. 1) Admi Pashu Bhakti - Those who cling to old spiritual habits and training. All told to them by the Master is involuntarily forced through their habitual matrix initially formed from old training.  2) Aurat Pashu Bhakti - Those who are so dogmatic about their beliefs. They often disregard or go against the wishes and instructions of the Master but they are so attached to their Pinda minds that constant fights between what they feel and think versus the Master's instruction constantly rage. They are the lowest in consciousness and cause the most pain for the Master."" - VioletJones via ReligiousForums*

**Gary On 9/11:**

 *“Do you even think that something like this could happen that was not supposed to happen? How about those who translated at the World Trade Center? Is this something bad? Is this something where these people were totally innocent and were just unfortunate by-standers that got caught in a terrible event?""*  
*""If that is the way you look at it, it means the law of justice is not exact, that means the Lord Anami does not know what he’s doing”…""He most certainly is aware of what happened in New York City during September 11.""*

*""Please don’t be shocked by these events. It is pitiful, it is too bad they had to happen, but where does God put all the people that don’t realize it’s essence within them? Where do people go that want to fight and deny, and just worship their own ego? Right here in the pinda world, that is where they come.""*  
*""I want to teach you that what happened was right in God’s vision. Was it Pat Robinson who said that the hand of God had been taken off of America? I got a good laugh at that. God has put his hand ON America!""*

*""Terrorism is as much God as what we would call morality. Morality did not work, but terrorism did. So I take my hat off to terrorism and this situation because it brought these nations together and scared the living wits out of them.""*

*""I had a couple of letters asking why I was not on TV and the internet consoling these people and telling them it’s okay and where to get their food. I had to write them back and tell them that it is not my job. That is the Pope’s, the priest’s, the minister’s job. They think their job is changing the world and that they are going to bring the whole world to whatever savior they are representing. A true master or saint has no concern for the world and the conditions that it is in.""*  
*""How about the financial implications? With the World Trade Center coming down. World Trade Center…is that not befitting? The whole thing is that financial giant of the world. Finance has completely replaced spirituality! People actually think that if they have a hundred bucks in their pocket, they are basically saved and money can buy them anything, even God! I think it is very fitting that finance took a huge blow to the belly, and that it was exposed, and that it was so vulnerable.""*

*""America has been far too passive in how it has handled certain issues, and did America get burnt on this one! The way America went into shock and disbelief when it’s financial center was ruined. America was found sitting on their hind end! America back in the 1700s was created for a purpose, and that was to bring out the light and sound. America is leading the whole world. Everyone tries to be like an American, even though they hate us. It is jealousy, that’s all it is. It will be fun for all of us to watch to what heights it ascends."" Violet- CultEducation Forums*

**And finally, lest one forget, Gary Olsen on doubts, criticisms, or introspection:** 

 *Truth and the Seeker, Vol. V, Number 8, ""Sat Guru Bahkti (Part B)""  "" The stage of 'Resignation to the Will of the Sat Guru"" is very high, but also very difficult. Of Course, many say that they have resigned themselves to the sat guru; but as a matter of fact, one who has completely surrendered himself to the guru, holds no one dearer than him. Only those who have reached this stage can make this claim.""  ""They who love the sat guru, do not want to hear anything else except his glory and greatness. He who has faith in the Master sees no blemish in him. If he were to become critical towards the guru he would lose his feeling of love for the Guru. One should therefore never try to find fault with the sat guru. Only he who behaves like this will be a gurumukh, and reach the final stage one day.""  ""A true gurumukh is he who looks upon the Sat Guru as the Lord God, and does not question any of his actions nor let his faith in him suffer.""* 

**Honorable Mentions for this Effort Post:**

""Chelas"" are to wake up at 3am to ""contemplate"", they do this while staring into the eyes of a 8 x 12 photo of Gary, in a squatting position with their thumbs inserted into their ears, chanting ""Garji"" (who is Just Gary, btw.)

Chelas are to fast for three days before seminars on carrots, rice and water.

Chelas are to stop loving anyone but Gary, though ""maintain the illusion of attachment on the outside.""

Chelas are \~allegedly\~ to take an oath after a certain initiation level (The initiations are general rip-offs of OT levels in Scientology) vowing to not share the information they receive, for it may HARM their loved ones and the general public.

While ""seekers"" and ""aspirants"" are repeatedly told that the MasterPath is only one of many paths and is entierly free and safe to leave, once a Chela begins paying their dues ($30/m) they are told that if they are to leave, ""untold misfortune"" will befall them. ""The worst thing a Chela can do is leave the MasterPath.""

&amp;#x200B;

In an attempt to make new friends I went out to dinner last night with a couple that comes into my restaurant frequently. They’re super positive, genuinely nice and we have some common ground in that we move around a lot. I’m going to try and highlight my key takeaways from the conversation. So they shared with me their beliefs on thoughts being energy and forming the world around you. The whole Law of Attraction and The Secret kind of stuff. They talked about how were all living in a simulation and that 8 digit codes can be used to access it so you can be in “the driver’s seat.” Several times a ranch in Washington was mentioned which after looking some stuff up I’m assuming is the ECETI ranch. They told me about Kevin Tredeau’s Your Wish Is Your Command and how that has changed their lives. Also they acknowledged that he was jailed for some trumped up charges and to not let that sway my opinion. There is some other random stuff that seemed weird to me but that’s the gist of it. I’m not judging them on their beliefs but it just sounded a little cult like to me. I’m curious if this sounds familiar to anyone out there."

I have read cult books about this euphoric type of feeling you get when you are with a group like this such as , AA , NA , rehab groups , hospital groups , church groups etc

cults,js36s6,The Landmark Forum is a Cult,"I recently went to [The Landmark Forum](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/) course after doing the Landmark Forum introduction.  I definitely knew prior to participating in both that I wanted to document and share my experience, however, didn't know where to post (r/AntiMLM or r/LandmarkCritique crossed my mind). 

To begin, I need to be very clear.  I did not want to do the course or the introduction and did not pay for the course.  My boss who holds places in other areas of my life encouraged, pressured and advised me to. 

The Landmark Forum shares their course syllabus, times and content on their own website.  Their 'transparency' is another step to luring you in.  

**Main detail points:** 

* 3 days, 9am to 10pm
   * This is said to keep the momentum
* Breaks every few hours
   * They 'ask' you to start putting their taught methods into action and if you return early from a break, staff will begin conversations about anything Forum related mainly to ask about the actions you took in your break (so your break is not a break)
* They tell you to sleep well
   * Not being able to sleep well is something they touched on (it's an excuse)
   * They give you assignments every night that can take a lot of time especially after a full day

I took notes from the moment our Forum Leader began speaking.  They advised quickly that we would get MORE from the experience by not taking notes, I disregarded this message.  Halfway through the day, they asked everyone in the room to promise two things, one being ""I will promise not to take notes."" In a room of 40 people, 7 which are staff, it was hard to not raise my hand and promise this. 

The entire weekend uses **basic** psychological concepts, but they've taken these concepts, altered them and then applied their own language.  They will tell you about the importance of language, again explaining psychological theories without telling you their name, the study behind it, etc.  Because they are loosely based on REAL theories, there is truth to some of their teachings, but if you're reading this, you're on the internet, everything you can learn there, you can learn for free elsewhere (look up personality theories on Khan Academy). 

**""We are not a cult!""**

They made a point of saying this but I think it made themselves appear desperate.  Whilst 'convincing' everyone they weren't a cult, a common tactic is asking questions that elicit a 'yes' which is done over and over.  They let us go home, so they're not a cult apparently.  Most of their workers are volunteers, we have to adopt 

**""You disagree, come out the front!""** 

As said before, most questions will make everyone say ""yes"".  If you disagree, you're encouraged to, but it means you have to come to the front and argue your point.  Fair enough!  However, you have to use their language otherwise they use your language against you. 

**""We don't give answers!""**

Our Forum Leader repeated this over and over.  It's a conversation which is about engagement.  They want YOU to DISCOVER the answers for yourself but only if you use their language, agree with them and do everything they tell you. 

**""You should call your dad!""** 

*This is subjective*.  They encourage you to reach out to everyone in your life that you're not 'complete' with.  One staff member interrupted my break by starting a conversation about calling my father.  She was giving ME life advice.  I remembered her name (let's pretend it's Becky), I looked her up on FB when I returned home.  I was being told life advice by someone who is overweight, single, volunteers for a cult and only job is working for the MLM scam Scentsy.  Obviously, this point makes me seem like a horrible person.  Being told for three days that I'm living on the sidelines, not in the ""arena"" by people who IN MY EYES are living in the sidelines frustrated me.  I wanted to make this point to emphasise how much they preach for authenticity and to basically take life by the balls.  However, was Becky taking life by the balls by eating more than her calorie output, remaining single and loving her MLM job - then you go Becky.  I'm proud of you.  OR was Becky simply lacking the courage to improve her life in many areas and clung onto the first community that accepted her?  

&amp;#x200B;

The entire course preaches about living your authentic life, being authentic and having integrity.  If your authentic self doesn't align with THEIR wants, values and goals then you're not living your authentic life. 

Everything they do is about pressuring you to spend more money, do more courses, do more, more and more.  They know their demographic are people searching for answers, searching for guidance and self-help.

I won't go into detail but basically I was there for 6 months and since then I've moved home. The only thing is that my parents have gotten involved and now that I live at home they continue to use the behaviours and sayings that trigger me, I know this because when I do certain things (when I'm out) and when I talk to other people I'm okay, but because of how surpressing the behaviour is (rubbing their nose in midst when I'm talking) or standing up when I'm talking, it continues to surpress and make it feel like my words aren't important. I end up carrying this behaviour and it's really weird because I continue to have urges to share when I know they aren't the people to share with, I know that this behaviour is because I was in a cult and I'm trying to get back to myself but it's very hard since I'm living at home and looking for a job. Do you have any advice on how to handle the situation? Sometimes, the behaviour ends up leaking to outsiders that I talk to because it must condition me to seek this behaviour and of course we are all very social creatures. Please let me know any advice on how to handle this situation. So far I've decided to speak positive and encourage (if they are involved) that I am glad they found something they believe in, have interest in.... But it seems their behaviour is preventing me from being able to socialize with outsiders, it's not like I'm going to go crazy but so much of it has been and continues to be very surpressing. Any advice is appreciated."

cults,jrlz16,Airrosti might be a cult and is absolutely a scam,"I've been interested in all sorts of bodywork modalities since I had my first chiropractic appointment many years ago.  I just moved to Texas and hadn't established care with anyone for chiro, massage, or PT yet and I woke up with a gnarly kink in my neck after a particularly intense deadlifting session.  So, I jumped on my insurer's website to see who's they'd cover near my house.  I'd heard great things about Airrosti and they were the second one down the list.  So, I called to schedule.  The lady that helped me make the appointment was unusually enthusiastic and engaging for a medical admin, but it didn't set off any alarms.  They had an opening in two hours.  Great.  Let's do this cuz I am moving around like Herman Munster on a cold day.

Upon arrival, I noticed that the waiting room is immaculately clean, branded with Airrosti's colors and font, walls are plastered with infographics, and TVs on the walls that are running their highly-polished YouTube videos.  I took a seat and heard the familiar ""ka-chunk"" of... a magnetic lock releasing?  Slightly off-putting, but not exactly a red flag yet.  As the front desk attendant walked out of that door to greet us, I heard a cacophony of voices yell ""wooooo!"" from down the hall behind that magnetic door.  The front desk attendant was doe-eyed, animated, enthusiastic, and used words like ""amazing"" and ""wonderful"" when greeting me and the two other gentlemen in the waiting room.  Now my Spidey-sense was tingling because the last time I saw behavior like that, I had a co-worker offer to buy me lunch and then corner me with a portable DVD player with an informercial and offer to bus me to an ""amazing meeting"" in a far-off arena to be pitched on joining Quixstar (Amway).  


Another ""ka-chunk"" as one of the Airrosti practitioners came to the lobby to retrieve their patient, and this time I heard what sounded like canned sitcom laughter from down the hall.  Another ""ka-chunk"" and then raucous applause, and I was officially weirded out.  Fourth ""ka-chunk"" and it's my therapist, a young, enthusiastic, wide-eyed woman in the Airrosti-branded scrubs and flashy Adidas sneakers.

She takes me into her office and proceeded to use a bunch of unusual, but honed and polished language about the human anatomy and described to me what is going to happen during the session and then made me sign something that read that I promised to pay before we get started.  It's would be $50 for the session, AFTER insurance.  That's 2.5x my old chiro co-pay, but I'm here and I'm curious, so let's go.  

The session consisted of some manual myofascial release work, which I appreciate, but no adjustment, as Airrosti does not manipulate joints, then some education on my exercise and PT plan to perform on my own.  I walked out of there with the same stiff neck but $54 lighter with a really expensive lacrosse ball and no knowledge that I didn't already glean from some anatomy and PT reading/YouTube vids or from my old chiropractor who provided the exact same services and information that this woman did, but also adjusted my neck so I could actually move it, and did it for a $20 copay.  They also pressured me to make two follow-up appointments before I walked out, both of which would cost me $50 dollars each, which I immediately canceled when I got home."

Supposedly, these people have ""partners"" throughout the country making a network to support people. The mentorship opportunity is supposed to help trainees ""develop cashflow assets especially within the ecommerce and mobile commerce markets by leveraging non-productive time."" Seems kinda fishy but ok. Then this friend asks my girlfriend if she would be interested and sends her an application. The application has very little to do with any kind of academic or professional qualifications. It's all kind of personal.

cults,jqg7kp,My youth weekend leader is involved in a cult like MLM(advice needed),"(Sorry for my bad English, i’m Dutch)
Since 2012 i go once a month to youth weekend for children with autism/ADHD because of my autism. I’m one of the more smarter ones out there and i’m recently began my study after graduating college when somebody there told me about this sub. Here is the story: Since 2019 a new leader of my youth weekend was  been introduced to my group. She was someone who was initially being nice and interested towards me and my group. After she wanted to show photos of her on instagram i saw that she was heavily involved in a US based company called Forever living. About 90% of her feed on instagram is about the benefits of this company and its products. After some research i discoverd that the company has a cult like reputation in our country due to it’s false claims and cult like behavior. I first thaught she was not like that extreme ones because she was nice to me and my fellow comrades on the weekend. And then anything changes.
Firstly, she was trying to get the other weekend leader into the Forever cult by claiming that a women in England was cured of rheumatism because she drinked aloë vera daily. Then she was trying to sell me and others on the weekend her “wonder drink”. But there was one thing i heared that really shocked me.
A friend of mine who’s also on the weekend with me told me that he was strugling with his homosexuality and with telling the others on the group that he was homosexual. For advice on how to tell the others he turned to the weekend leader and asked her help. Then she(the cultist) told him that his gay feelings and his homosexuality in general a disease was and it could be “healed” with the aloë vera drink that she sold. Then he bravily told her that it isn’t and left the room. After that weekend my friend left the group and told me that he was insulted, sad and angry at her. Now i am going to that weekend next week and want to confront her with this because i do not accept this kind of behavior towards any of my friends. But how can i confront her because she is very deep into the Forever cult. Do you have any tips of advice for me because i want that she understands the message."
cults,jq2uhm,Please Please Help- friend in a cult,"It’s difficult to even confirm for sure that she is in a cult (given its very nature, I suppose), but her middle-high school friends and I are most confident that she is.

During her last year of college, she started attending this “bible study group” that was apparently affiliated with our college but later turned out not to be. Soon after, she broke up with her partner, moved across the Hudson to live in New Jersey where more members of this bible study group apparently lived, started cutting off her friends, stopped attending classes at Uni and wanted to drop out. Last time I saw her (years ago), she couldn’t hold a conversation for a SINGLE MINUTE (absolutely 0 exaggeration) without mentioning Jesus and the Bible. 

Things we know:
- She has cut off all social media
- Cut off all friends she has ever had (from best friends from high school, former roommates, ex-boyfriends, to relatives)
- Moved to Germany because apparently the “church” had a big following there, but not sure where in Germany
- Convinced her mother to join this cult, after introducing her to some higher members of this “religion”. Her mum has resisted our efforts to get in touch with her as well.
- This cult has a very wide reach (stationed at universities, apparently big in Germany and Europe, and potentially even has members even in HK where her mother lives)
- She is now married (her mother told her relatives in a sudden message that she is married to a german Master’s student but would not disclose name or any other details about this person, less give an address that relatives could send wedding gifts to)

We have known her since her early teenage years, and am not convinced that she cut ALL of us out simultaneously for some reason that is unrelated to this cult. It was too abrupt and the changes we all saw in her personality and priorities were too jarring. 

Does anyone have any information that might help? Any cults/churches/branches of religion that sound familiar? It’s so frustrating to look for a nameless, headless church that apparently wields so much influence and we’re all very, very worried for her. All we want is to even get in touch with her once and know that she is okay.

Please help, and thanks in advance!"

Here is my senior paper for class 2020! 

Lol but yeah this is more for me but if ya want to read go ahead, have a convo about it...  I really do think in a few years maybe a decade there will be a Netflix documentary of trump being a cult leader 

Trump is a cult and here’s why 

a leader has negative narcissism or “traumatic narcissism” 
Meaning he’s causing harm  

“The hard fast narcissist” someone who grew up being a narcissist they feel completely entitled to lie to you, to put a face on to get you to believe what they’re selling

“The malignant narcissist” they don’t care about the damage they are doing. They need to be adored, loved, wanted. 

A cult leader might do: 
“Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.”
“No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.” He can’t talk to press because “the questions are to hard”
“Paranoid about the outside world” (Cults thrive on conspiracy theories, catastrophic thinking, and persecution complexes.)
“Demoralize former members” now trump has not done this to his members but has done to his components and people who work in the government saying his components/government are lazy, and deceptive to try to gain followers and to shape the followers minds to his narrative
“The leader is above the law” and we all know that Trump believes he’s above the law
“Thought reform method” brainwashing The fact that you can present facts to someone who is a Trump supporter And they still don’t believe you. You can give them science and they still don’t believe in science!
“ Group of elitists” they seem to think they are the enlightened ones the solution for the worlds problems 
“No financial transparency” trump has hidden a bill inside his 2017 tax act to increase taxes for people who make less than 100,000 a year after 2021

he knows his demographic and knows what to say to control people it’s called “charismatic leaders” they thrive on chaos they use chaos to their advantage they promised salvation they promise a lot of things Charismatic leaders tend to be authoritarian and power-hungry They create a dangerous situation

Then the leader set up a hierarchy (Aka the proud boys, White supremacist, neo-Nazis, trump supporters) to Carry out demands we’ve all seen this happen"

cults,jpgt79,Maum Meditation,"I don't even know where to start with this. Recently within the last month I started going to this local meditation center and started receiving guided meditation. I was introduced by a friend who has been telling be about this place for such a long time. I went in for an introductory session and was hit with a $150 monthly fee if I wanted to continue (should have been the first red flag). Anyway, I figured I'd give it a chance and decided I'd be going every day to get worth out of it.

The whole idea of the meditation is to go through your whole life from birth to present day and throw away images of all your memories into the sun. This part really makes sense to me and gives a great feeling of relaxation afterwards but it isn't until I did further research that this is part of something called ""Maum Meditation"" There are 8 levels of Maum Meditation which already makes it sound cult-like. Maum Meditation is a cult.

Anyway, I don't want to get too deep into it but what I'm having trouble with now and what I'm here to ask for is advice. After doing further research on this type of meditation, I can see where I can start to get brainwashed, I can see where everything makes sense and why I should leave it. I go in the morning at 10am and by the time I get home I feel clear minded but I also feel super tired and need to take a nap. Is this normal for meditation? It's like I am mentally exhausted which also ties into brainwashing. This sounds so dumb but the people there are so nice and I've begun to form a relationship with them. I don't know how to go about just up and leaving as well as letting my friend know I stopped going. I know it sounds so dumb. I'm also questioning now what real meditation is? The method they use for level 1 made so much sense to me. But I don't want to get sucked into this and get brain washed! After I leave I'm certainly going to meditate but on my own. I just want to know what real meditation is now ;-;. The hardest part is believing that it's a cult. I feel so dumb being sucked in. But I always thought meditation could do no harm and these people are so kind."

What cliches do you feel are overdone, and what aspects of cults do you feel aren’t really touched upon at all - but may be even more terrifying/unsettling than the cliches? 

I know there are many different facets and sects of cults, so this is a pretty wide net I’m casting with this question...however, I’m curious and would love to hear whatever you all would like to contribute.

-you can't come to the session if you can't pay.( she was about to invite me but since I'm still a student with no money she figured I'm not fit for the group) 

- ever since she joined the organization, she live two lives. She wont tell us the address of her other home.  Nor about any information on who she lives with. But she comes home once a week and she gets angry if we ask her about her other home address.

-they call  their spiritual leaders ""masters."" 

-  she has been doing hand rituals / mediation rituals, and has been believing the spiritual superstitious beliefs thought to her as if its tthe only truth in this world.

-she reached the status of a healer. She has this book with meditation and rituals in it to cure  different types of sickness. Pimple, cough, cancer. You name it. That book have it.

- she became pescetarian about joining the group. 

-she became distant. Honestly i think she only goes home to wash her clothes.


What do you think? Should I be worried?
I think she is happy with the organization. I am only looking out for her. During this like this (pandemic) not knowing her address is really scary."

cults,jmh73i,Advice on getting parent out of cult,"Recently my sister and I found out that our mom is getting sucked into a cult led by a South Korean politician named Huh Kyung Young. She’s been spending money on him and watches his lectures on YouTube religiously. Over the past few weeks she’s been planning a trip to Korea (we live in Canada) in the middle of a pandemic, saying that it’s to visit our grandmother. Recently we found out that she’s been lying to us, and she is actually going because of this cult. We are worried she is going to keep spending money on him, get COVID from the gatherings, or get seriously hurt and put herself in danger.

Some info on the cult:

\-led by a man named Huh Kyung Young. He ran for president in South Korea many times and has accumulated a significant following over the past few years

\-He claims that he is a surreal being

\-says that anyone who believes in him is immune to COVID

\-claims that he can cure any disease by looking at people

\-charges money for events and “therapy” (which involves inappropriately touching people)

\-main demographic of followers is middle aged women

Our mom has been widowed for more than a decade and has been living on her own for almost two years. We think this started about a year ago after a close friend introduced her, and the isolation during the pandemic has made it a million times worse. We plan on confronting her very soon as we need to stop her from going to Korea at all costs. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to approach this topic with her? She does not know that we know this much - she has only mentioned this man a handful of times to us. We want to make sure she doesn’t feel attacked.

Any advice or resources would be much appreciated. Thanks so much."

I need someone to explain this cuz its bizaree . I see why black ppl fall for nation of islam especially given americans history and alot of those  lack supremacist groups started up as a direct response to their white counteroartd.

I dont get why so many rich / upper class whites continously get caught up in these spiritual movements . You would think these groups would target lower class lowly educated white men and women but several of these cults from what I've seen specifically only want educated people  and its Bizaree to me. The other funny thing is majority of the time the cult leader does not have the educational background or accomplishments of the recruits and his or wealth is built up by money they give him. So I dont understand this whole thing of successful ppl following a person who has never accomplished anything in life and getting scammed by them."

cults,jljm91,I Don't Know If I Have Left A Cult,"I'm on a throwaway account because people involved in this organisation know my main account. I'm not sure if this is the right sub, my head is all over the place and I'm hoping someone can give me insight. Also, sorry for the length of this post.

I joined a non abrahamic faith organisation around 15 years ago. Everyone was so nice. Friendly without being overfamiliar, and generally good, down to earth people. 

When I first joined, there was a huge focus on eco responsibility, non consumerism, learning (both texts related to the faith and wider subjects like history, art, and music).  It was a real joy to meet up with others from the group and I made some good friends. There were yearly dues to pay for membership, but accounts were openly accessible and we could see where every penny went.

Slowly, the emphasis has shifted. First, the mission statement was amended, just the odd word here and there, but on a regular basis and it now bears no resemblance to what it once was. A lot of the old members have left over the years.

The focus moved away from eco campaigning and conservation. Consumerism began to be encouraged, if we were buying from other members, their friends and family or approved retailers. We were given lists of acceptable learning materials and told to throw away any we owned that weren't on the list. We were no longer allowed to know what our dues were funding.

Initially there was no acceptance of people who had been convicted of certain crimes (domestic violence, s*x offences, cold blooded murder, drug dealing etc). But that changed and there are people who have committed these crimes in influential positions. 

Worldwide Rituals were introduced, which every member was expected to take part in at the same time. This could mean getting up several times in the early hours of the morning, and they were held via Facebook, Skype, and lately Zoom, so the head of the organisation could see who wasn't taking part. The result of missing a ritual was a public shaming, and horribly cold and vaguely threatening letters and emails. We were given duties that were designed to make us feel like we were important to the organisation, but which were often  expensive and time consuming.

The political emphasis changed. Initially we were non political, then there was a shift to the right, then a shift to the extreme right. I had been getting more and more uncomfortable and was on the point of leaving, but I had seen what happened to other members when they left and was afraid for my own mental well being if I left. 

The final straw came when the 'chapter' I belonged to tried to force us to allow someone who had been convicted of one of the worst crimes imaginable to join. On the surface we had a free vote, but we knew we had to vote along the guidance of the chapter leader. 

I left. I was exhausted with the late rituals and being woken up by overseas members, confused, worn out, I cried all the time, I felt low and worthless, I hated what I had allowed myself to be moulded into. 

Within a day or two, I received emails and letters from the heads of the organisation saying I should 'come home'.  I was so confused I said I would. The following day, I had another email saying I had been saying bad things about the organisation on line (I hadn't), and I was not welcome back. Then I was, then I wasn't, then I was, then I wasn't. That decided me. I would not go back not ever. Since then, I'm receiving abusive emails and letters from other members and my workplace has been contacted anonymously with horrible untrue accusations against me. They know these things are not true and are supportive. 

Do you think this organisation has become a cult? Or am I reading it wrongly? I literally don't know what to do with myself without being part of the organisation."

I know they're rather private, and they have armed guards at all entrances, and a friend from High School told me that they're supposed to give the leader their money and let him divide it all up amongst them. I think they have to eat together on Sundays, and one particularly gruesome story says they capture people to indoctrinate them. How much is true, and how much is just fear mongering? How deep does the manipulation of this cult go and why do they do it?

cults,jkzk3n,Do the leaders believe their own lies?,"There appears to be no definitive answer for whether cult leaders believe their own lies. I guess you could put them in the general “Cluster B” psych disorder group, and that’s true for all of them. 

But I’m specifically interested in what you think about cult leaders. 
-Manson: a race war is imminent so murder these innocents and frame black ppl 
-Jim Jones: mass suicide is revolutionary bc the government is threatened by our teachings of socialism and equality 
-Applewhite: (Heaven’s Gate) Leaving the “vehicle” of the physical body will allow us to be raptured up to a spacecraft 

I know these are very simplistic versions of their beliefs. 

I’m fascinated by the question of how much the cult leader believes of his or her own “doctrine.” For example, did Manson want to ACTUALLY start a race war, and think his plan was a feasible option? Or was he just losing control and wanted to exact revenge on high society people?"

cults,jkwebl,The science-backed psychology techniques Nxivm used to 'fetishize vulnerability' and manipulate members into sex,"""But with Raniere's EM method, a Nxivm member shared their vulnerable and traumatic past in front of a crowd. When Raniere or another high-ranking member running an EM deemed the member had a breakthrough, the audience clapped and cheered in celebration.
According to Scott, this set-up intentionally creates positive reinforcement, so members want to share even more vulnerable information.

""The group is providing influence and pressure on the person to expose themselves. They're getting positive reinforcement when they do [expose themselves]. People are cheering, people are smiling, people are are reinforcing it,"" Scott said.

Vulnerability can lead to helpful mental and emotional breakthroughs when expressed in a safe space, but Raniere's methods removed that safe space under the guise of accountability.

Nxivm taught members that if they shared the most fragile parts of themselves with an audience, everyone in that audience could make sure they wouldn't fall back on their previous negative ways of thinking and acting.
In reality, this framework only turned vulnerability into a commodity or ""highly valued currency,"" Scott said.""

cults,jk3x0p,Are hundreds of new-age spiritualists coordinating one massive con? Or do they all just share similar delusions?,"The new age movement is filled with people who claim to be spiritual experts or that have had spiritual experiences. I notice that multiple people within the movement will claim to have experienced similar outlandish situations like having had telepathic conversations with alien star children, communicated with guardian angels, been abducted by aliens, communicated with human/animal spirits, or have the ability to channel multidimensional beings such as Kryon, Bashar and Abraham Hicks etc. Most of the time these people do not seem to have coordinated a scheme/con, they genuinely seem like strangers who just all claim to have had similar experiences. It is baffling to me because it seems like there are hundreds of people making very in-depth claims. Also, the fact that multiple people are stepping forward with such experiences makes the claims even more believable to their audience. I am just wondering what could be a possible explanation for this? It doesn't seem like a promising ""get rich quick"" type of scheme because it genuinely takes a lot of time and effort to consistently play a character that relies on such a niche and complicated story. For the most part, the people who do manage to cash in are only a small group of people. I would understand if it was just a handful of people with one or two stories following the same theme but it's truly hundreds of people with all sorts of claims. Could hundreds of strangers from across the globe all just be dedicated to the same con? Are they all genuinely sharing ridiculously similar delusions? Do they believe that they are being truthful and helping others? Are they just a bunch of bored narcissists who get a thrill out of having any sliver or power and influence?

Revictimization occurs when a person who has already been victimized is victimized again. This is surprisingly common and abusers know all about it. 

For example, I revealed to someone, who at the time I trusted, that I had been a victim of sex trafficking. This person then began grooming me. Fortunately it took very little time for me to figure out it was happening and I was able to get away from him. He ""revictimized"" me because he believed that I was an easy target.

I've seen multiple posts on this sub that seem a little suspicious so I wanted to speak out. Please keep yourselves safe and be wary of anything that seems off. 

As a cult survivor, I believe that I've been through the mill and because of that, I am very aware of anything and everything that seems dubious.

October 27th, 2020

Your Honor,
Beyond Keith Raniere’s crimes as documented in your court, there are moral crimes this man has committed. Specifically against those that were under his care. The crimes were willful and intended to cause maximum damage.
There are the physical things Raniere has done to people. Coerced them to starve themselves, sleep depravation, cutting them off from their friends and family, closing doors on their life and career opportunities, shunning, terrorism by litigation, branding, triangulating his students against each other, maliciously squandering the child bearing years of dozens of women, convincing people he knew better than their doctors… resulting in them forgoing medical treatment they should have had. These are all terrible things. But it is the psychological and existential injuries which will continue for the rest of our lives… that I find the most heinous. 

—————-

Keith Raniere, 
You have done irreparable harm to peoples psyches. To their self-esteem, their belief in themselves and their experience of sanity and well being. Their qualia of existence.
I believed in you. I believed in your mission. Because I thought it was the same as mine. I believed you knew what goodness was. Finding out the truth about you and your actual motives turned my world upside down. You broke goodness. You cracked the firmament of my belief in nobility and honor and righteousness. I do know how to repair it. I do not know if it can ever be made whole again. I fight everyday to try and recapture something that now feels lost.
This was not by accident on your part. When I was writing the film Carbon Crimes, you wanted me to craft a female character of innocence and good will. Someone who worked for a leader she believed in with all her might. She then finds out he is in fact a very bad man with very bad intent, using everyones pursuit of goodness for his own ends. You described to me how it would break someone like that and how she would never be able to heal from it. She would never be able to find goodness again. It would be forever poisoned. You knew exactly what you were doing to me and many others. The loss and the pain is incalculable.
And the worst part… the truly sick part of this is that my trauma, the desolation of my psyche is your great joy.
As the founder of the Society of Protectors, you told us constantly to MAN UP. To strip ourselves of everything to find our true self. You told us on a daily basis how in the worst circumstances we could find joy. Remember how you quoted Albert Camus; “In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.” And yet here you are suffering about how miserable you have been in prison without your comforts. 
Your ideology was all false bravado. A boastful lie. 
You made us believe we were constantly failing a standard you are wholly incapable of meeting yourself. You just wanted to destabilize our psyches as much as possible so that in our growing psychosis you would be the savior, watching us get worse and worse. Like poisoning us and watching us die slowly. Our happiness wasting away. That is your true joy. 
You could at least have the decency to admit what you wanted was so very primitive.
How cruel to convince women that sex with you would heal their sexual abuse trauma. How childish and devious to use principle and honor as a cover for a teenage fantasy of getting a group blowjob from a group of women. How shallow are you? Clearly your joy DOES come from the external world after all. You were just seeking infantile comfort. Turns out, contrary to your lawyers assertions, you DO need coercion to get sex.
You and your followers need to ask yourselves one important question. How did you Keith Alan Raniere cause this? Stop being a victim. Stop suffering. The world's reaction to your omnipotence did not cause your present circumstances. Your evil did…
You will never know true love. You have to calculate everything. 
Kindness, compassion, awe, morality, weeping at pure goodness. 
While I will struggle for the rest of my life with what you have done to my mind and my soul… I can FEEL all those things you cannot. My morality is intrinsically mine. Your emptiness is yours. Forever and ever.

—————-

Your Honor, 
I spent 12 years studying this man. He has a belief that he is the next evolution of human-kind. Beyond worldly ethics and morality. Far superior to this court. He thinks he breathes the rarified air of an awakened genius. But he is none of those things. 
He is a malicious, petty, evil and dangerously vengeful sociopath who thrills at our pain, and yet barely a glimmer of that excitement is visible on his blank face and his dormant eyes. He has been a lascivious little toddler with too much power and ZERO accountability. He has stolen hundreds of years from all his victims and poisoned their existence… poisoned my existence… and he needs to be held accountable.
Thank You for your time.

cults,jfrol3,I need outside perspectives.,"I grew up in a Christian camp. Well known if you're a Christian in California or maybe even just being in the US. They have international locations as well. 

100 people year round, more during the summer to help with the summer camps. I can understand going to camp or being a summer staffer would be harmless and even fun. But year round and behind the scenes weren't 

I was an outcast. My parents were divorced, I wasn't white, I didn't have close in age siblings, and my dad wasn't much of a dad. Parents, or literally any adult, didn't like me. It's about 2 hours away from the nearest city, you could choose not to go to Church but you were looked down upon, if you were gay forget it, they'll fire you when they find out. The act like being gay is okay UNLESS you want to live there. Adults could not be a different sex's house after 10, if you do and/or become involved with anyone, you're gone. No dancing, no pre marital sex, no divorce, no LGBTQ, basically all the beliefs of extremist Christians. We were made ashamed of our bodies, ashamed of sex even if it's post marriage, we had intensive classes to learn about other religions and how to persuade anyone to convert, all while trashing them all. We were strangely punished for not pledging allegiance to the flag, as women we were taught to basically be slaves to our husbands, so far to the man has the last word and no matter how many times you say no, you must have sex with them. No abortions and so on. I remember when I started dating a boy adults would literally take shifts spying on us. They also believed that when you get sick you've done something to deserve it, so when I got sick for months (it lactose intolerance) people would try to get me to ""confess"", my father and I had multiple screaming matches over it. The only way I got any sort of help was from my non-christian mom who I was allowed very little communication with. The biggest of all is they seemed to think that, unless it had to do with converting someone, no one deserves to be helped. They were so consumed with converting people. 

They never said that people couldn't leave, but they payed you so little that it's incredibly hard to leave. If you don't have outside help then you won't be able to leave comfortably. I know plenty of people that had to stay much much longer than they wanted. There's also a small group of children (I'm included in this, I'm 23 now) that did normal rebellious, but not inherently bad, kid things that aren't really welcome anymore. We can visit, sure, but they make sure you don't enjoy it.

There's a lot more. But this is already long enough. To me these things seem so small, especially compared to bigger cults. However, I know my eight year stay there has graced me with quite a bit of religious trauma. There are things that are still engraved in my brain that are hard to shake. I'm having an extremely hard time processing it because I know these things are normal among Christian families. But in the end they're toxic things, right? I know the things they did were wrong or that they feel wrong to me now and I don't believe in 95% of it anymore.

I just need you guys to help me validate and process. It's too messy in my head to sort it all out. 
Thank you."

Back when we thought “cult” meant “strange group in the woods worshipping Satan Or Cthulhu, and probably sacrificing babies.

Among the figures we worshipped were “Beyblade Moses”, “Bidoof”, “Jenova”, and “Flying Spaghetti Monster”.

A couple of months ago I ended up being admitted (voluntary) to a psychiatric ward because I was starting to believe things that I was taught as I grew up in an evangelical cult in the U.K. things like this was the end of the world. And other things like they were going to insert microchips into us. All things I was taught from the age of 1-14.
There’s been other things I’ve remembered since. 
I’ve struggled with mental illness for over 20 years but this was different. More like a psychosis.
I just wondered if there was anyone else out there like me.

The Sacred Vagina may be blessed and worshiped in most any location. Privacy is usually preferable, but even in an elevator, or on a crowded bus, a worshipful man may touch the moist lips of his beloved.  This simple action serves as a momentary, joyful blessing.   
For more satisfying results, a longer ritual is encouraged. \~Within a clean, quiet place the worshipful woman chooses a position, sitting, laying down or standing, to make her vagina easily accessible to her lover. \~The man says: ""I aspire to worship the Cosmic Yoni within you.”         He kisses the vaginal lips of the woman.  With caresses he brings forth her sacred vaginal fluid.  Additional lubrication may be used if needed. \~With fingers, the man caresses, at times inserting fingers fully inside the vagina.  The woman will tell the woman exactly what motions best please her.  He will follow those instructions. In this manner, sex-play may continue until woman attains satisfying orgasm. The woman may also finger her own vagina if she wishes.  A vibrator or dildo may also be used if she wishes.  The goal of this ritual is a sustained, full and satisfying orgasm for the woman.   


The ritual being complete, if they wish, the couple may whisper and sigh endearments and continue their love-play, allowing the man also   to reach a full and satisfying orgasm. 

Do it right!  And your cult will not get bad press!

cults,jfdm4z,The Message of William Branham,"Greetings! I’m happy you’ve come across this article, I’m Theosebes, I’m a young former message believer, currently I’m a non-denominational Christian inquiring into Orthodox Christianity. This article should give you an overview of the “Message”(this term refers to it , the Message of William Branham, which is called the Message of the Hour and occasionally the message of Jesus Christ.) God bless!

The “Message” is a evangelical heretical movement that followings “Prophet” William Marion Branham, there teachings are, odd. 
1. Three groups of people, sinners headed to hell(they can be saved) Christians that are simply saved but not born again and will be eternal servants to the next group, the Bride of Jesus Christ, this group consist of Message believers now, and the followers of the six last messengers in the past, which we’ll get ok. Message believers will commonly call denominational Christians; “Foolish virgins.”
2. Seven church ages, seven messengers, the seven being, the Apostle Paul, St Irenaeus, St Martin of Tours, Saint Columba, Martin Luther, John Wesley, and William Branham. William M. Branham(simply called Brother Branham within the cult) wrote a book, “The Seven Church Ages”, this book is both a plagiarism of Clarence Larkins book on revelation, and, is full of lies.
3. Serpent seed doctrine, the message teaches all intellectuals, officials and such are serpent seed, and some common folk, they come from the serpent and are literal children of Satan, the fall was caused by Eve having having relations with the serpent, who Branham described as a chimp.
4. The Holy Ghost, being filled with the Holy Ghost means you accept the “word for you hour/day” and the evidence of it is love according to message theology.
5. Branham is the last “major word Prophet” and he fulfills Malachi and all the prophecies of Elijah, which in reality, as our Lord told us, were fulfilled by John the Baptist. Branham combatted this in two ways, occasionally he would reach John the Baptist only fulfilled the first half of Malachi, on other occasions he taught John fully fulfilled Malachi and Branham “fulfilled it the second time”.
6. Only message believers take part in the “rapture “ and the resurrection(this is problematic for many reasons.)
7. Branham, as testified by many people(this is true) who witnissed him, read minds, and performed many miracles. He also prophesied, though all of his prophecies weren’t fulfilled, and to perhaps none were.
7.5 Fun fact; my dad became a message believer because of a dream and bad experiences.
8. Message believers hold two images in high regard, one is a picture of William Branham with a “pillar”(actually a halo) of “fire” over his head, which, has been verified as unaltered by a private investigator, though, one must note, this image was taken in the Houston Coliseum, wherein, at the same location the Beatles had pictures taken of them with similar “pillars” of “fire” hovering over their heads, clearly one deduces this is a light. The other ‘sacred’(while not called such, it is viewed as such) image is that of “the Cloud” which was take in Arizona by time magazine, Branham’s daughter stated a rocket caused it, meanwhile, William Branham claimed it was made by a “pyramid of angels”, later images(altered though I forget how) had “facial features” in the cloud, some of them take this cloud to be “the Lord will descend from the clouds”.
9. Problematic doctrine.
Branham taught the Trinity doctrine was and is “a damnable doctrine from the pits of hell.” He claimed it was created at Nicaea by the Roman Catholic Church(the mother whore of revelation)Yet, he also stated, “He did in that age just as He did in all ages, and like He will do, just as He promised to do. God promises anything, then He comes down and proves His Word to be right. All that believe, all that believe the Message of that age, come in and was saved. So will it be in any age. All who did not believe the Message and the messenger, perished.” 64-0816 - ""Proving His Word"" Rev. William Marrion Branham
He therefore taught, to live and not perish(spiritually of course), one had to accept a “damnable doctrine”. He also lied on many occasions.

cults,jfb7g0,Established podcast - looking for co-host,"Hi! 

My wife &amp; I have an established podcast focusing on Religious Trauma and Cults. The format to date is interview/conversational style. We interview people who have left Religion. We go into their background and the turning point that caused them to leave. The goal is to build a community around those who left religion while being mindful as to not bash religion. We’ve had some really cool guests and would love for you to listen to an episode. 

We’re looking for a true partner that can add value to the show. This can mean you’re an ex-cult/ex-religious person or you may have a very deep interest in the subject. Here are some responsibilities that we’re hoping a co-host to bring. 

*Ability to hold a conversation, keep an interview moving along (you don’t have to be a professional interviewer)
*Extreme interest in subject matter 
*Social Media (Instagram) experience &amp; willingness to create content and stick to posting schedule 
*Ability to stick to a timeline. Goal is to record every 2 weeks or a month (open). Need to develop a timeline together on roll out dates to achieve consistent episode releases. 
*Have the ability to buy your own microphone for recording 

Bonus experience 
*Website development 
*Ability to edit episodes if necessary
*Experience growing a brand 

At this point this is an unpaid hobby and passion project that we do. We really enjoy it and have had very good listenership since the beginning. We continue to grow with instagram followers organically. The goal would be to grow to a point where we could start to have paid ads, create merchandise, etc. 


Thank you &amp; looking forward to hearing from you!"
cults,jf9t6w,NXIVM - Thoughts and A Request,"I just finished watching ""The Vow"" on HBO MAX (don't mean to plug them) and I have some thoughts. 

First, some background: I am an individual who is very interested in the dynamics between physical self, the psyche, the world and each other. I also try to keep a very open and objective mind. I am of non anglo saxon descendance which I believe is relevant to the stories and cases which make up the large epic of NXIUM, ESP, DOS and SOP. 

Putting all that aside, now that I have finished watching The Vow, I feel this is another one of those cases where there needs to be a separation between a Creator and their Creation. Aside from the multi-level marketing aspects of NXIVM (which anybody would tell you to stay away form, in any of its forms) I see the organization as a collective Icarus, or maybe just Keith. In the Finale of The Vow, there is a moment maybe abour 3/4 of the way into the episode where a woman of African-American descent recalls she had a brush up with the organization and made sure to stay away because she is too ""aware"". This makes complete sense to me because as a non anglo-saxon descendant their experience in the world may require them to build a layer of skepticism based on institutionally biased dangers or stereotypically-driven dangers (at certain times and in certain places, thankfully not everyone allows a person's appearance to modulate their behaviors). All of the people involved in NXIVM were objectively very trusting and non-skeptical, potentially because they don't need to be aware of hidden dangers. This is probably more a question of conditioning, because it doesn't only have to do with race, but could also be completely due to differences in passed experience between individuals. The group-think and irreversible act of branding is what I see as the reason for ultimate downfall of NXIVM, and Keith, which is why I bring up the story of Icarus. Control your loins, man.

Anyways, I am not here to preach, just some thoughts I wanted to get out there to discuss with you all. For my request: I would like to receive all modules (probably videos are best because I am a very audio/visual learner, and I am able to do that while doing other things; reading requires very focused attention) I would like all this material because I am very interested in the Psyche and I feel strongly about my point of separating the creator from their creation. Some of the concepts and things I heard on the The Vow made sense at a very deep psychological level. I'm not looking to join anything, or start anything, just curious and being objective. A stoic philosopher (the lover of knowledge).  


For anyone that has experienced loss either mental, financial, or physical either to Keith or the enablers around him, I sincerely feel for you. All I can say is I hope you are able to build back stronger and use your experience to better yourself and the world around you. 

All the best."
cults,jf703f,Anyone else grown up in the Church of Christ Scientist (Christian Science)?,"To give context to anyone interested, I was a 5th generation Christian Scientist and left the faith within the last few months. I was a staunch believer for 19 years until I realized not only the amount of crazy in the church's teachings, but also how much pain, emotional abuse, and physical suffering I witnessed and endured in the church. The church denies the label of cult staunchly, but it fits so many of the key markers. I'm incredibly scarred by my time there and have recently started going to therapy specifically to undo the immense amount of brainwashing I was subjected to and to work through a lot of the painful memories and emotions remaining. 

Christian Science is an American religious cult founded in the 1870s by a New England woman named Mary Baker Eddy. While MBE isn't worshipped specifically, her extremely problematic history is glossed over and she is highly revered and romanticized in the church. Christian Scientists believe that her revelation (that is, the creation of Christian Science) is in itself the second coming of the Messiah. 

Christian Scientists believe, essentially, that Jesus Christ was the ""Wayshower"", and he demonstrated that anyone can practice spiritual healing the same way. Christianity is therefore  a ""science"". Christian Scientists believe that the physical world is an illusion and that any physical or emotional suffering you experience is caused by fear or ""an error in thought"", and can only be rectified by praying to God to understand that the material world isn't real, only the spiritual world, where everything and everyone is perfect. What this comes down to is that if you experience a physical or mental illness, it's implicitly known that it's your fault for not ""understanding the truth"" well enough. 

Modern medicine is not forbidden by the church, but there is immense social pressure to prove that you are gifted enough in prayer not to seek it out. I watched my grandmother die of untreated bone marrow cancer because she refused to seek any medical help whatsoever. I've seen other family members and close family friends suffer from completely treatable and preventable illnesses, and I know of far too many people who have died from them too. Things like pneumonia, appendicitis, breast cancer (which has a high survival rate for those who seek treatment), etc. I watched my mother allow a mild UTI to go untreated so long that she was hospitalized with an advanced kidney infection. Obviously during this pandemic, I'm beyond terrified of what might happen if a family member or friend gets sick. They simply won't get help. 

I'm diagnosed with PTSD for unrelated reasons and my CS parents and friends believe that I am selfishly holding onto my suffering for attention, because I've chosen not to work on my mental health through prayer. Anytime I get sick, I have this overwhelming guilt that it's my fault for not focusing hard enough on God. It's going to take me a long time to undo all of this, and so few people know of this religion or of how dangerous it is that it feels extremely isolating."

She was doing online sessions with them when lockdown started in March, I just thought it was pretty cool doing yoga/meditation to keep her occupied...I had no idea what would happen next... She has quit her job, flew over to Germany a few times to do 'retreats' (Horn-Bad Meinberg) where they are renting rooms in Aura Meditation Center to spread their message of 'awakening' in Germany from Russia. They have been going around children's homes apparently saying they are going to save everyone from poverty, cure cancer and end western civilisation. Honestly, it's just like the Wild Wild Country Documentary but they're not as big.

She has spent around £3k pounds and is giving them free labour in the centre (online marketing, cooking, cleaning for them). She has zero money to her name, in debt, her boyfriend is in bits and worried he's not going to see her again. We are just constantly giving her messages of support and reminding her we miss her. There's no point telling her shes in a cult as she gets angry with me. She says she will be flying home for a visit but never gives us a date/ keeps changing mind... She has her phone taken from her at the centre, I managed to have a video call and it looked like a hostel hotel... I rang her phone once and someone else answered saying she was busy, it was so fucking weird. She rings her boyfriend up some nights in a dark room away from others in tears saying she needs him to send more money to pay the cult... She is acting as if out closest friendship never even mattered, she is telling me I'm selfish being part of the capitalist regime... but there she is giving away all her assets to this stupid group.

I am so upset/ worried/ angry/ pissed off that I didn't see the warning signs more of her being drafted into the cult group. I have never experienced anything like this at all in my life. I have no idea whether she will come back to UK. I miss her so much but it's like she doesn't care. Please, please give them a bad review on Facebook or on google reviews or something.

Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I would appreciate any thoughts on this.   
   
A family member in another state has become involved with an online program called 'Wealth' run by someone called Carolyn Elliott.   
It is styled as a program to empower women to be financially successful, but from what I can glean, it has a few hallmarks of a human-potential type cult: 

\- Applications are vetted and only a select group admitted.   
\- My family member has reportedly started meditating with specific mantras assigned by the leader.  
\- The program costs around 1000 dollars/year but there are opportunities for intensive courses etc and something called a 'gifting circle'.   
\- There is a hierarchical system members can progress through; attending the courses etc can lead to more rapid advancement,   
\- Leader seems charismatic, her websites says she was previously involved with an Orgasmic Meditation group, and I found a video online where she spoke about growing up in - or around - various cults. 

There is a lot of info online about Ms Elliott and the program but nothing that clarifies what it actually is, and in fairness - also nothing about it being any kind of cult. 

So, ultimately I am unsure if this really a women's empowerment group, a cult, an MLM, a pyramid scheme, or if I have just been watching The Vow too much. 

Grateful for any thoughts.

cults,jb9dgs,Question,"How should one be if they are in, what media and individual opinions think of, a cult, but the cult is actually helping and improving their life? Should they stay with it if it is making a positive effect on them as a person and they feel strongly, in a deep down way, happy from it?"
cults,jb1e2t,What to do about potential cult calls,"So about a month ago I got a call from an unknown number. I’m the type of person who would answer a call like that, so I did. It was a generally creepy call but just kind of seemed like a church call. It went as such: “If you are in a tough situation we the Lord is on your side” I’m Christian and everything, but this was weird. The guys voice was weirdly intense. Oh and after he said all the he’d say PRESS ONE PRESS ONE PRESS ONE PRESS ONE PRESS ONE. So I did, because I’m dumb. The phone just hung up. I got the calls more and more often and i’ll admit it got pretty annoying quickly. Also I couldn’t block the number because they’d call from different numbers, in different states. The calls got more active but it was always the same guy always the same format. 

Recently however the calls have started to feel less church like-more cult like. A lot talk of ascension and money and crap. Like yesterday it was a sea of money coming my way. Maybe its not a cult, either way its creepy and theres no way to block it. Hands down the worst part of it is the calls i’m getting recently is the call I get randomly one or two times a day from random locations. Those calls last about 20 seconds. I always say hello and theres always nothing but dead silence, with some background noise. They hang up on me. Maybe this is all coincidence but I’m starting to doubt it. I’ve re-called the number(s) many times to no response. I originally thought that when I pressed 1 I may have put myself on a call list, but I don’t think I pressed 1 the first few times. Either way I need advice on what to do."

Early 2018: totally normal 18 year old. 

Mid 2018: removed all wifi routers from house started sharing articles on Facebook about the dangers of wifi 

Late 2018: completely got rid of cellphone only form of communication was via Facebook on computer with hard wired Ethernet connection 

Later 2018: goes to a European country for a month to go to some sort of event that discusses the dangers of 5g, wifi, and cell phones. 

Early: 2019 very hard to make plans with spends most of the time inside. Has removed all light bulbs and now only uses red light to illuminate room 

Mid 2019: guests must now leave cellphones on airplane mode or outside when at their house 

Late 2019: not much changed 

Mid 2020: all contact with all friends has been mostly entirely dropped. Usually only getting one word as a response 

Last week: multiple mutual friends including myself receive very cookie cutter message about how we are being removed from their life and that all of their social media accounts will be deleted. Meaning nobody will have any way to contact them whatsoever"

cults,jaj5mn,My experience with a self-help cult and a song I made about it. It applies to a lot of the False Prophets out there. They must be stopped.,"One year ago today I went to my first ""weekend conference"".  I had been doing the meditations for a year and was always weary about things because a friend was really into it and had spent lots of money.  When I started I was at rock bottom and I was desperate for help.  This is exactly the type of person and situation they seek out.  

My friend was my ""trainer"" but he was not paid (it turns out almost no one is paid but the supreme leader).   The indoctrination attempts on our weekly calls usually fell short, I saw through most of it and was actually quite shocked at the things he was being told.   He had been in the cult for many years and worked one-on-one with the leader.  

When I went to the weekend conference my logical mind was breached.  It broke me, my empathetic nature was compromised.  The oxytocin flooded my nervous system and I was engulfed with emotions I had never felt before, at least not in this high of a dose.  Witnessing someone being completely vulnerable and then being ""healed"" of their emotional trauma was like watching the ending of 1000 tearjerker movies all at once.  When I came down from this high I felt broken, I felt like I needed help and yet I wanted more.  There was a chemical addiction being formed over those two days and this hormonal rollercoaster ride ended with me signing up for a more expensive ""intensive training"" 4 day conference promising advanced transformation.

As weeks went by before my intensive training I grew more and more anxious.  My friend would tell me things like ""You will feel like you're dying and you might, and that's OK"".  That really helped my anxiety.   I was having no positive effect from the first conference.  I had less motivation at work and in my creative life and I began to question things.

Soon after this my trainer/friend lost his job... AGAIN.  It was the 5th time since he was in this cult.  He was spending tens of thousands of dollars per year for 8 years, he had been to dozens of  intensive trainings, coached others on being successful and achieving goals and he couldn't succeed at a job for more than a year?   I began questioning what type of brainwashing could be occurring at this training and if I would turn into this person.  I didn't want that life.   I didn't want to be in a cult.  

My plan was to attend the first day of the weekend and leave if I didn't like what I saw - luckily my body and intuition had it's own plan and I suffered an injury one day before my flight.  I saw the true colors of this organization when they refused to refund my money even though my spot was filled.  The rabbit hole went much deeper when I connected with other members who had left the organization.  They had been victims of spiritual and mental abuse at the hands of the leader and other executives of the company.  I confirmed my assumptions that they are operating a pyramid scheme that uses dark NLP and deceptive psychology techniques while providing a human connection network built through trauma bonding and exploiting the quest for enlightenment and world peace.  The leader becomes your therapist/hypnotist going into your deepest traumas in your most vulnerable states while he uncovers your patterns to use against you.   Now you work for him, recruiting others and supporting him financially for your never ending training.  He will tell you that you will be more powerful than him some day and you are raising the consciousness of the world.   If you question anything you are not acting from a place of love so it cannot be true.  There is no truth.  Except when he speaks, of course.  

This song is about my experience.   I hope it can help others.

cults,jacgmh,What is the Kingdom of Manna?," I'm concerned my Dad has been sucked into a cult/scam. I recently confronted him when he brought it up, that I thought he was being indoctrinated into a cult. He didn't respond well to that, and claimed that the 'Kingdom' had embassies in 60 different countries. He appears to be taking information from sources linked to this organisation, which I don't think is really very smart...

The link to the webpage of this 'Kingdom of Manna' is here:

[www.kingdomofmanna.global](http://www.kingdomofmanna.global/)

Honestly, we've lost touch and we can't really have a chat about things without him getting at my throat, but this is like a genuine concern.

From what I can gauge from the language on this webpage, this organisation promotes the idea of every individual being their own sovereign being/nation. It reads rather confusingly, but if you exchange terms like 'Sovereign Nation' for 'an individual', it begins to clear up.

The dude in charge, His Majesty and Grand Knight blah blah blah, surely is the 'Kingdom of Manna' as it says.

What do these people do?

Because she had realised that hes a no good man who takes sexual favours from his female members. This information exposing him was sent to her by a member of another small organisation that he funds. I thought they were safe people because they pulled her out of that illusion about that man so I didnt stop her from joining them, shes in a groupchat with them now too. 

Fuck man I dont even know anymore, she hadn't gotten better at all from that time, instead shes just gotten worse... small things like becoming a corona doubters, anti masker, anti vaccination (and these were all things we had joked about together,  about these idiots ) but then she told me that if I loved her I should never get vaccinations. Well that's not the point of my post but I wanted to show how her behaviours slowly changed. 

Just this morning she had a psychotic break I think. Started crying and yelling (something like ""wake up wake up wake up"" and other stuff)  mumbling then banging at my door (I had locked me and my brother inside my room) shes been glued to her phone for days now and hasn't been sleeping either. Shes stressed too because of other stuff I wont get into. 
After what ever happend ended and she calmed down my father told her to sleep and I thought she did but shes still on her phone and talking in some groupchat (thinking it's that organisation) when I told her to sleep she started crying, saying how she didnt know that she ""has to save the world"" 
My father is unreliable. Hes not taking this shit seriously at all, treating it as just her acting crazy cause shes always on her phone and not sleeping, even turned it into some lesson joke to my brother about how this is what will happen to him if hes always on his phone. 
I dont think so though, I think this is much more serious and I want her to get help. But what the fuck am I supposed to do I'm barely keeping up with my studies right now and the one I thought I could rely on to do something (my father) is barely doing anything. 

I think I wanted to minimise what was going on, the way shes acting,  everything.  But I don't think I can do that anymore, it's all so scary and I wasnt prepared for something like this."

I used to follow them, left because I didn't like how they talked about chronic illness being my fault and needing to quit my prescription drugs, and their support of Teal Swan.

As I spent time away from them, I started to realize how harmful some of their beliefs were.  They were pretty classist, telling people to just grow their own raw organic vegan food if they can't afford it.  ""Patch"" encouraged people to stop taking antidepressants and other ""big pharma"" drugs but then encouraged people to take hallucinogens.  He's invited his followers on multiple occasions to a retreat where you take maaassive amounts of Ayahuasca for five days straight.  He's shown hostility to major religions like Islam but fetishizes the spiritual practices in the other parts of Asia because ""exotic"".  He told people to drink crystal water without any guidance, which if done with the wrong crystals, can poison you.  He's said to give homeless people crystals instead of money because ""it will help them more"".  He 100% thinks Jews are Martians.

And then recently I found out he raped his ex girlfriend.  He said he wanted to do a chakra cleansing ceremony with her and forced her into it.  This woman told Teal Swan, who she was a follower of, who victim blamed the crap out of her.  Then this woman went to Jordan and recorded their conversation, in which he admitted that he raped her.  Then he made a video talking about it in which he says he thinks Emma Watson is lady god.  Out of nowhere he talks about how he was accused of rape, and he phrased the whole thing like he's the victim, like he deserves pity.

He blames the whole thing on his upbringing: his father dying at a young age, growing up in a prudish and yet sexually explicit society, yadda yadda.  He talks about how in the realm of masculine and feminine energies/entities, there is toxic masculinity running rampant in society.  And while there is truth to that, he said ""But we also have to combat the toxic femininity taking form in the seductress."" He started to slut shame and victim blame in one take.  I'm appalled.

I wasn't sure if Jordan really fit the criteria for your regular cult leader, but now I'm sure of it.  Jordan Duchnycz is a racist, anti-Semitic, misogynistic, classist, ableist, creepy piece of shit and I hope that with his current obsession with Emma Watson that she never has to learn of his pathetic existence."

This man presents himself as a Hebrew who talks about spiritual topics like how you can be your own god and such, however when he mentioned that he had people who ""followed"" him that's when I started getting worried.

This man's gamertag used to be called thehumblehebrew, I talked about spirituality and mixing it with some aspects of asian religions like Hindu or Buddhist.

Anyways, I haven't been in a party with this guy in a long time, I've gone my own separate way and got more into politics then religion and such.

But recently, I managed to get a controller and a pair of earphones to work so I look through the fallout 4 post and sea that someone with triumph in their gamertag has repeatedly spammed some sort of Christian gospel sayings, and I lowkey believe it's the same guy.


To sum it up, I think there's a cult on Xbox. This man has a baby who is less then 4 years old most likely, and im sure his ""following"" are younger people, around the age of 9-14 I would say. 
An age group easily influenced when it comes to these types of things.

Really I want to find out who this dude actually is, and what's just up with him.

Sure, its okay to change your religion and share it, but when you constantly bring it up on a gaming platform, preaching it every second and changing your religious ideology constantly and even claiming to have a following, that brings up red flags."

I guess I'm wary for a few reasons:

1. There seems to be a significant focus on the ""cult"" (in the less nefarious sense) of the founding gurus Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. They are long deceased but the daily prayer services, for example, include calls to them and that just seems a little odd.
2. It does seem to have a lot of monastics, which could be normal but also can point to a high control group.
3. I believe in something resembling the theology of what gets called ""neo-Hindu"" or ""generally Dharmic"" religion - but it's well known similar groups can gravitate to cultism. ISKCON or even Self-Realization Fellowship seem to have a fair amount of bad press online. But so far I haven't seen anything on Vedanta Society?"

Long time lurker but I've never posted anything. I wanted to share a story with you, hoping to get some feedback. This might be a really long story. Sorry in advance!  
Two years ago to the exact day, I was asked to go on a 'retreat' with a small company that I had just been hired with a couple days before. The experiences I had on those 3 days were very strange and off putting.   
In the Summer of 2018, I was very unhappy with my job and impulsively quit before I had anything else lined up. I spent 3 months incredibly stressed, trying to find another job before my savings dried up.   
I finally got a call back for an interview for a PR company. (Not sure if I should divulge the company name. It would be cool to get help from someone who can look into them but I don't want them to trace this back to me. Let me know what y'all think!)  
The role was for an Administrative Assistant. The pay wasn't great but it was the kind of seemingly low stress role I was looking for at the time. Plus, I liked the idea of working for a small company after quitting my job with a large corporate office.  
Before the interview, I was asked to take some sort of intelligence test (nothing out of the ordinary), for which I had to be on camera to take. Once completed, the ceo/founder scheduled a video call with me. The video interview went normally. I felt like I didn't do that great, being on camera makes me nervous but I got a call for a 2nd interview!  
The 2nd interview would be at their offices. This is when things started to feel strange to me. According to this company's website, they had been around for about 10 years and had some pretty impressive accounts. Especially for such a small boutique agency.   
Their clients included the city's park system and even airport. So when I walked into their dingy, under decorated office, I was a little confused.  
I don't mean to sound elitist or shallow, that's not necessarily who I am, but it was somewhat dissuading to know I'd be working in what looked like a church basement. Maybe the company wasn't doing as well as it looked?  
Still, I NEEDED the job. Maybe it's true the company had been around for 10 years, but perhaps the founder is only just now getting good business. Maybe it had just been her the entire time and she's just now starting to hire a team?  
Interview happened. Went pretty well I thought. Another of the founder's employees was present. She looked to be about my age - 27 at the time. The interview lasted about 10 minutes if that, and I was sent on my way. A couple hours later, I was informed that I was hired and sent an on-boarding packet  along with instructions to take a DISC test. I was also invited to meet he rest of the employees at a dinner they would be hosting. There would also be a company retreat (conveniently) scheduled for that weekend.

From here on, I knew something weird was happening. Not to sound all hippie dippy, but I'm very sensitive to energies. I can ALWAYS tell when others aren't being truthful with me or being conspiratorial. Plus, I'm just naturally interested in secret societies and cults. I like reading about their rituals and methods they use to induct followers. I say all this to explain that I was not going to be easy prey for them, I'm way to aware. 

The dinner was scheduled for a Thursday evening. I was asked to dress formally. I was also informed that there would be a couple guests attending. Jan Goss and her husband Rick Gibson. I was asked to review Jan Goss' teachings on 'Civility Consulting' (???) and the night's topic would be 'Dining Skills' (???).

Okay, what?? My alarms are now blaring. The company I was just hired for is a Public Relations company. Why the hell do we need to learn dining skills?? I'm already EXTREMELY put off. I learn that Jan Goss is a wealthy motivational speaker and am put off even more. Motivational speakers are hacks and charlatans. I have no respect for them, nor do I want to be around one and have to kiss her ass. 

At this point, I reach out to my dad to ask his thoughts. He saw nothing weird or out of the ordinary about any of this. He was excited for me and told me I was overthinking things. ""As the CEO of a PR company, your new boss probably just wants to ensure her employees align with her brand. Looks are everything.' Eh... that made sense.

I show up to the dinner. There are 4 other employees at the very small firm. They're all my age or a little younger. 2 women, 2 guys. I notice right away they're all sort of quiet and have a slight air of insecurity about them. Not unlike me. 

Also in attendance is the CEO of course. Let me describe her - rather rotund, Black woman. On the fairer side. Very freckly. She wore her hair straightened and cut in a very severe bob. She had an intensity to her that made me a little uncomfortable (not necessarily relevant to the story, but I'm also a Black woman. I have a weird complex about being around other Black women that I'm trying to work through. I have a tough relationship with my mother and grandmother and it bubbles up when I find myself in company with Black female authority figures)

There is an older man who I'm told is the accountant for the firm but he works offsite. There is also a hippie-ish looking woman who does graphic design. She doesn't work in the office either. And of course there is the motivational speaker, Jan Goss (look her up) and her husband for some reason, Rick Gibson. There is also a photographer. Upon entering the private dining room, all the employees are made to stand against a wall for a picture. (Keep telling myself, that's not too weird. A picture isn't weird, right? RIGHT?)  
The entire dinner the Jan Goss lady is teaching us about fine dining. Where to lay your knife and fork, how to properly pass a dish, stuff like that. And I'm silently getting more and more pissed. Why do I have to learn this? What does this have to do with the job? This is so weird, I don't care what this lady has to say! But I try to keep an open mind and be nice. I try sparking up conversations with my new coworkers. They seem easygoing and nice.

They keep mentioning how important it is to be a worldly citizen. How important it is to be sophisticated and 'show up well' wherever you go.

Jan Goss' husband starts bragging about all the money he's making on his new venture. Something about inventing QR codes to put on boxes for moving companies. They'd have the ability to scan a box and know exactly what's in it. Okay?? Whatever man. (The QR thing will be relevant later).

Throughout the dinner I realize the CEO has gotten up and traded seats with a few people at the table. I didn't notice it at first, but she ended up making a full circle at the table. I don't think I was supposed to notice this. She'd take the seat of whoever got up to use the bathroom to talk more closely with the person next to that seat or just plain ask them to switch places. 

The dinner is wrapping up. Jan and her husband leaves. It is now just the CEO and the hippie graphic designer and the 4 other employees. The CEO starts to tell us what to expect from the retreat. She tells us all to wear comfortable shoes and to empty out our trunks. She tells us it's going to be very hard and we're not going to like it. That's all the info she can give. 

I'm very annoyed and apprehensive at this point. This has all been so weird to me! I call my parents and let them know how the dinner went and they're completely unfazed. I call one of my closest friends and he's a little weirded out too but tells me to keep an open mind. The company might be just a little quirky. 

I'm admittedly an overly paranoid person, maybe I am overthinking things! So the next morning I put on a business casual outfit with Nikes and make my way to the office. I'm wondering if we're going to be taken into the woods for an obstacle course or maybe a treasure hunt or something.

We all get to the office suite. The door is locked so my new coworkers and I stand outside awkwardly. I'm very uncomfortable at this point. My instincts tell me this is all so messed up. Finally, we're called in. As we walk in, the CEO bangs a gong. Don't like that...

We're asked to sit down. The CEO seems very giddy. The old hippie graphic designer is there too. The CEO starts saying how glad we're there. How happy she is to know us and how proud she is. I feel a little awkward because I just met these people a couple days ago. She gives this long speech about how hard today is going to be and the entire time I'm seething. Why is everything so mysterious and weird!?

Then she smiles a huge smile and calls a woman's name. Suddenly a door at the back of the room opens and an old, old woman with gray box braids down to her butt walks out. We're told this woman is a stylist to the stars. The retreat will be getting a makeover. ...

My new coworkers erupt in excitement and cheers. Ummm... But I don't feel like I need a makeover? I don't even know you people! I hold my tongue...

We're told we'll be getting new outfits, a manicure/pedicure and our hair done. WTF! I'm so beyond weirded out, y'all! This is strange, right? I start texting my friends and parents... 'How cool! Your new boss sounds great!!' -\_-

We're asked to sign a release form. We're asked to give permission for any pictures that are taken to be uploaded onto this stylist woman's social media. They all sign without hesitation. I know I shouldn't sign but I really need this job and I don't want to seem ungrateful or make waves. I speak up and tell them that I'll need to review any pictures taken of me before they're uploaded. I even write a little clause into the form I sign. The stylist and the CEO give each other a look but agree. 

We're split up. The two guys go with the hippie, while me and the two other female employees go off with the CEO and the stylist. First stop is the mall. We arrive at Macy's and they immediately beeline to the LINGERIE DEPARTMENT. Okay, no. No, no, no. This isn't right. I speak up. 'Why do we need new bras and undies? I don't feel like I need new bras and undies, I'm uncomfortable with this'. The CEO shuts me down by saying, if we're going to try on new clothes, we need really good fitting bras. Otherwise, the clothes won't look as good as possible.

Now, in hindsight, that is not a good reason to be forced to pick out underwear with strangers. At the time though, I had JUST realized I was buying the wrong size bra and what  a difference a good fitting bra makes. She said kind of made sense. Because it is true.

So there I was, looking for underwear with strangers. We're asked to find 3 bras and 3 pairs of underwear to try on. They had sales associates come in and do fittings for us. I am beyond mortified. I hate being touched. I hate being naked. I hate being this vulnerable around strangers. This all seems like some weird dream.

While amongst the racks, I corner the other two girls. I ask them if they're weirded out by all this. I ask them if they're okay with this and they tell me they are. In fact, they've been excitedly giddy the entire time.

We eventually all find bras that fit us and we move on to the next department. The stylist had already chosen about 5 or 6 outfits for each of us. They're all business formal outfits and dresses. Nothing quite in my taste, but then again, I rarely have to wear business formal. In fact, I didn't really own much business formal. We're all given $300 gift cards. 

We try on the outfits and the CEO and stylist give their opinions. Poking and prodding. A girl who looked a little younger comes into the dressing room and greets the CEO. I'm told she is an intern. She gets out a camera and starts snapping us as we come out of the dressing room. 

Everything in me is telling this isn't right but maybe I'm the crazy one! Maybe I'm so cynical and hateful I can't recognize when someone is doing something nice for me. So I keep my mouth shut and keep trying on clothes and letting a stranger take pictures of me. 

We choose our clothes and make our way to the registers. I've ensured that what I've chosen doesn't go over the $300. My coworkers end up having to have the CEO pay $50 or $75 because they went over. The CEO leans over to me and quietly commends me on being organized enough to think about the budget. 'This is exactly why we chose you for the administrative role. You're perfect.' Okay, lady...

Next are manicures and pedicures. I am now going to take a moment to describe my new coworkers. The one who was there for my interview is a Latina woman, a little tomboyish. I learned that she is originally from Mexico but spent most of her life in The States. She is a little more confident and outspoken than the other employee but I found myself feeling sorry for her because something in me KNEW she wasn't the type to wear the dresses and nail polish she was asked to wear. Not once did she ever disagree or say no to anything though.

The other was a smaller, more timid Filipina. She was very soft spoken but very excited about everything that happened that day. She never questioned anything that happened either (Yes, I know ethnicity doesn't necessarily matter. I just want to paint a full picture and have you see what I saw)

I wouldn't describe myself as butch or a tomboy at all, but I've never been comfortable wearing nail polish. It's just not me. But I go along with it. I'm especially uncomfortable with the pedicure. My feet were ROUGH lol. I was very embarrassed. When I texted my parents again, hoping to get a little validation in how I felt, the only thing my mother had to say was 'Well, I'm glad you got your nails and feet done!! I'm sure you needed it!' hur hur. 

I know this has become such a long story, I'm sorry. Please stick with me!

Now it was time to get our hair done. I had secretly resigned to saying 'NO!' to this. I know being forced to cut one's hair is a brainwashing tactic. This is where I draw the line. We get to the salon and the stylist asks my new coworkers what they're comfortable with. She practically forces them to divulge whether or not they'd give in to having hair cut. 

When she gets to me, I firmly say 'I'm not comfortable with having my hair cut'. The CEO and the stylist clearly don't like this. They try to get me to at least have something done. The stylist spends a little time trying to get me to change my mind. She tells me 'You could be a covergirl if you wanted. You're so beautiful' I tell her 'I know'. She doesn't know how to take that. At this point, I've become certain that this company isn't what I'm made to think it is. Something nefarious is going on here. These are brainwashing tactics. 

They ask me if I'll at least get my make up done. I oblige. Even though I hate having my face touched. I then sit and wait an hour or so for the others to finish with their appointments. We then go back to the office to meet up with the guys and end the day.

Let me describe the guys. One is very good looking and seemed more sure of himself. Still pretty soft spoken though. He is blonde and white-passing but has a Hispanic name and a hint of an accent. The other is a very tall, kind of a goofy fella with glasses. His shirt (before the makeover) was very ill-fitting and he stuttered a little bit. Both seemed to be very sweet guys.

Once back the office, we were asked to put on our favorite new outfit. We all went into separate rooms or into the bathroom to change. We were then one by one asked to sit on a stool and talk about our feelings about the day. When my turn came, I was pretty honest. I mentioned how uncomfortable I was with being told what to wear and how to look but that I was happy to be apart of the team and I was grateful for what the CEO did for me (not so honest).

We were then sent home. I was very exhausted and drained. Again, when I tried to express how weird the day was to my parents, they rationalized it all by saying looks are important to PR firms. They treated me to a nice day!

The retreat wasn't over though. There was one more day. We came into the office the next day, not knowing what to expect. It ended up being a lot of weird team bonding exercises. We also discussed our DISC results. I actually don't remember too much of this day. 

What sticks out the most is me questioning (maybe even being argumentative) about something the hippie lady had to say about compromise and the CEO defecting to the hippie lady and asking 'What is she doing?' The hippie then tried to explain why I said what I said. I thought it was weird that the CEO asked the hippie instead of directly asking me what I meant. Like my way of thinking could be explained away by someone else. I then realized the hippie is the CEO's guru or something.

At one point we broke off into groups of two. We were told to be vulnerable and divulge to the other person what they like about them and then what bothers us about that person and then switch off to a new person. Remember, I JUST met these people a couple days before. I didn't have any experiences with them aside from this 'retreat'. EACH and every person, INCLUDING the CEO and hippie, mentioned that they felt betrayed that I wasn't open to getting my hair cut and seemed hesitant about everything. They ALL mentioned that I need to trust them and that things would be easier and I'd be happier with the company if I just trusted everyone. ALARM BELLS ALARM BELLS ALARM BELLS.

In the very last exercise, the hippie had us sit in a circle. She then began to lead a meditation of some sort. We held hands and closed our eyes. Not something I'm used to doing in an office setting but whatever. It was very effective. I gave into her voice and let myself go. When she was done I had a very warm feeling and tears in my eyes. They then all began to say really sweet things about me and seemed to know enough about me to reassure me about things I'm insecure about. Love bombing, right?

Then we were all sent home. I was given a few materials for my first day and was expected to be in the office at 9am sharp on Monday. I now hesitantly felt good about my new job. I knew everything was really strange but maybe they were right. Maybe I should trust in the CEO and her vision. One of the last things she said to me was ""We've been waiting for you"".

Lol but after sleeping on it, I realized that I definitely did not want to show up on Monday. I had $300 worth of clothes that I knew I should have sent back to them to return but I didn't want anything else to do with that company. I blocked their emails and phone calls. and threw away all their materials. Except for several sheets of stickers with bar codes on them. They didn't tell me what they were for. And for several days later, they emailed me about returning those sheets. 

One day I got the courage to finally scan one of the bar codes but it did nothing but bring me to their website. I then remembered the guy at the dinner who said he made tons of money from inventing some sort of QR stickers... I truly thing that PR firm was not a real PR firm. They were doing something else. Not sure what. Not sure why they seemed to specifically recruit mild-mannered, introverted types. 

I know I probably dodged a bullet but part of me wonders if I was about to be recruited into some sort of secret service, X-men group lol. 

I know that was incredibly long, thank you for reading!! Feels good to put all this out there."

Every channel was filled with spam by the owner named Osiris, he kept spamming the same sentence every day in each channel, “כולם יודעים שתיקה” which in hebrew means “everyone knows silence” (i don’t know hebrew i had to translate it so it could be wrong). I finally found a link in a channel called 907, the link was an invite to a server called “Love Hub” but in hebrew, i joined and i was led down a unforgettable rabbit hole, tons of gore, violence, rape, malware, ip grabbers and more. I was scared shitless to say the least, and after digging around i was about to leave until i got a dm from a guy who was a so called moderator in the server, he told me he knew where i lived and what i’m doing right now, he told me about “run sun” and described my own friend to me, the one that invited me to silence. I asked my friend about him and he never gave me a straight answer, it was always “what the fuck are you talking about?” “probably some loser” “i’m not in that server”. He seemed frightened at the same time, and plus he was in that server, i checked the messages he sent in the server and i was brought upon something horrible. He was apart of this cult named “House of the Red Sun” as the moderator mentioned earlier.

I'd also like to know what the process of being labeled a cult is in China if anyone has any info on that. 

Literally the only reason I'm researching on my own is because the creepy youtube channels I like haven't posted much about cults recently and so I picked a random cult to research and now it's 1:30 in the morning and I'm at a dead end. And I don't want to be a dumbass and go to any more sites with insecure connections. 

Thanks to anyone who's willing to help! My curiosity is killing me!"

cults,j3x37q,How Isolation Works," 

I must admit.  SGI does not  explicitly tell members to end contact or stop spending time with  non-SGI members.  Rather the isolation occurs two ways by the  practitioner's own doing:

* enticement
* practicing for others

Enticement:

Like Frank Ross said in the 1995 documentary *The Chanting Millions,*  "" People are approached from the standpoint of doing something for  their  personal lives, and, little by little, they are told that the  only way  they can advance their personal lives is to advance the  organization. ""  When I was in SGI,activity participation was considered  making a good cause or would result in so much good fortune.  Now this  may initially sound like a vacuous expression, howbeit it is very  enticing to people who may fall under one or more of these descriptions:

 

* Indigent
* Unemployed
* Underemployed
* Lonely
* Familial black sheep
* Marginalized group
* Recently divorced
* Recently broken up with a partner
* Abuse victim
* Recovering addict

To  people who fall in either one of these categories, the promise of  accruing good fortune to ameliorate their current estate in life is very  enticing.  To that end, of course they will sacrifice time with  possible non-SGI members; of course parents would sacrifice time and  involvement in their children's lives and spend that time in meetings  and SGI activities; of course parents would sign fukushi up for SGI  activities to the extent where in 2010 SGI  California parents paid  $1.75&lt;x&lt; $7 in bus fare to have their children go  to a kaikan  that was hours away from their home and participate in a  parade in the  rain.

 

(According to [u/anabeeverhousen](https://www.reddit.com/u/anabeeverhousen/)  : ""  I recalled that a few months before RTE,  the youth marched in the  MLK  parade in LA, in the pouring rain. Mind  you, this was several  miles,  and youth are as young as 12. They marched  for hours, came back  soaking  wet, after dancing, singing, promoting  RTE,&amp; SGI while  carrying A  GIANT FUCKING POSTER WITH IKEDA'S FACE ON  IT AT A PARADE  MEANT TO HONOR  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING,  (I got so sick  of the ""Ghandi,  Ikeda, and  King schtick). I get it, of course other  groups continued  marching.  Most things that are organized like this are  put on by the  city, and  tend to be rain or shine. However, other groups  were their  to support  the true honoree, any youth groups had their  parents  present to take  them home afterward. We all know that the youth  in SGI  travel long  distances (often without parents , in a carpool) to  go to  these events.  Think these kids had a change of clothes? Nope. And   what did the SGI  do about it? Soup. Lots and lots of fucking soup. I  was  byakuren, and  actually not been assigned to walk, but was at the  center  to help  organize in the morning, and in the afternoon/evening,  and the  marching  byakuren took breaks upon their return."").

\*Now  of course, these parents did not maliciously plan to give their  children such memories.  They were just so desperate to try to  ameliorate their unenviable estate that rationality for the most part  went out of the window.\*

With  the  promises of accruing good fortune, and ameliorating their estate,  members willingly sacrificed their time with outside friends for years,  if not decades.  Eventually it becomes an out of sight out of mind  scenario.  Before members knew it, they and their outside friends had  grown apart.  In the old friends' stead are the members of the SGI.

&amp;#x200B;

Practicing for others:

In  the SGI, the message that circulates from former NSA current SGI  practitioner to new members is that the quickest way to change your  karma is through shakabuku.  Shakubuku is in essence sharing the  practice with other people.  Howbeit in SGI it can also extend to flyers  for events or persuading people to register for events.  I must admit  that in a way this still falls under enticement, especially given the  history of SGI in the USA.

Picture  it: USA 1980. You're walking down the sidewalk of a strip mall when all  of a sudden an Oldsmobile Cutlass blasting Blondie's song ""Call Me""  pulls up beside you.  And the occupants ask ""Hey, have you heard of nam  myoho renge kyo?!""  They give you a card, briefly assist you with  pronunciation, and promise you that you can get stuff you want by  chanting for it.  And this scenario kind of pales in comparison to a  former NSA current SGI Many Treasures member who told me of how back in  the day she would even try to shakubuku hookers.

Now  post-1991, the practice for others has become less explicit; howbeit  that fervor remains.  I can attest to it due to the ardor SGI members  exhibited during 50K.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/gxuu5w/key\_point\_to\_50k\_victory\_be\_interminably/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/gxuu5w/key_point_to_50k_victory_be_interminably/).  

In the quest to persuade for Gohonzon  conferrals, or event registrations, more times than not members had to  be importunate like sales representatives.  In the realm of faith, this  may be considered noble; howbeit in the realm of human relationships,  this is considered somewhere between deal breaker and kiss of death.  So  practitioners engage in these potentially bridge burning activities,  find themselves cut off from non-SGI friends, and are isolated further  from society, and insulated within SGI.

Whether  with the enticements or the shakubuku, the likely result is isolation  from the outside and further insulaton inside the SGI.  Personally, I  found the party on the outside to be better.  Less itai doshin (many body same mind)."

Thanks again any knowledge is appreciated."
cults,j1i68v,The Internal Life of a Trotskyist Cult,"Becoming part of a Trotskyist cult is a heady experience. In the beginning, when you are in the process of being recruited, you are a 'contact' - an object of predation by your neighbourhood club of Jehovah's Leninists. You will be lovebombed into joining, upon which you will become a recruit and involve yourself in all of the usual activities associated with being a member of a Trotskyist cult.

As part of your 'political education' (i.e. brainwashing), you will be bombarded with the organization's literature, including stuff by the sect's chief theoretician, and deprived of the time to read anything else. By this means you will end up becoming an indoctrinated and deluded cult member. Calling it 'education' is a misnomer. The point of 'political education' in Trotskyist groups is not to broaden the mind, but to narrow it - to get people thinking a certain way and reading a certain way. As part of this process you will be expected to meet up with a senior comrade with a higher 'political level', who will help you interpret the sacred texts in a correct manner.

You will be expected to attend paper sales every week, which involves hawking trite agitprop to mostly indifferent passers-by, often in terrible weather. The paper contains article written by 'leading comrades' and a few pieces commissioned to junior members. (The paper even includes a fake letters' section, made up entirely of pieces commissioned by the Centre.) During these sales, you will spend valuable time with your 'comrades', which increases the feeling of companionship and togetherness necessary for any cult. It also furthers the process of indoctrination, since these sales are perfect opportunities to talk to and 'educate' new members.

If you are a university student, you will likely have a 'society' on campus which you use to recruit other people. The events held by this society will involve talks given by comrades on various issues. The point of these talks is to put forward the party line, not to encourage genuine discussion and debate. This is of course not how the events are advertised. Every cult has information for insiders and information for outsiders. Officially, these events are advertised as places to discuss and debate Marxist theory. In practice, they are a tool of indoctrination, hermetically sealed from 'alien class ideas'. Every comrade is coached to make 'interventions' in which they will affirm the correctness of the doctrine, and are taught to keep an eye out for 'contacts' in the room who can be recruited.

Throughout the year, all sorts of events are held at which comrades from across the country will be in attendance. At these events, rousing speeches are given about how 'only our Tendency' represents the forces of 'genuine Marxism', about how we will become a mass organisation in the coming years and seize power in a 1917-style revolution. Talks are given on all sorts of issues and the party line expressed and affirmed with enthusiasm by the participants, further drilling into members the 'correct ideas'. Merchandise is sold, including badges with Trotsky's face on them, which members are encouraged to purchase. It is a thrilling and exhilarating experience to be in the same room as so many people who think the same thing. In reality it is a disturbing echo-chamber which creates an illusory sense of brotherhood and comradeship that exists on a very tenuous basis - absolute, uncritical agreement with the party line.

The Central Committee has supreme power, in accordance with 'democratic centralism'. Congresses are rubber-stamps, at which things are decided 'unanimously'. Everyone is under party discipline to publicly promote the party line even if they disagree with it. The cognitive dissonance results either in dissidents leaving, or in those who stay conforming by bringing their private opinions into line with their publicly-expressed ones. This is how psychology works. The Central Committee must gives its approval for a political debate on any question, and the vote almost always goes the way the leadership wants. The members vote out of loyalty to the leadership and dissidents are forced to leave instead of be under 'discipline' to promote ideas they do not believe in. All Trotskyist organisations put a high premium on absolute agreement and on squeezing out 'alien class ideas'. There must be complete ideological unanimity. Differences are deliberately suppressed, even at the highest level of the leadership, and are not apparent until a massive crisis reveals that the leadership has split into factions. These leave the membership blindsided and almost always result in a split of the organisation. Splits are seen as 'purifying', following on from Trotsky, who believed that they were the best way of preventing a scratch turning into gangrene (i.e. minor deviations from becoming full-blown heresy).

'Socials' with your comrades are bizarre affairs. Everyone calls each other 'comrade', there are endless jokes about 'dialectics', in-depth political discussions about this or that phenomenon with incredibly primitive Marxist 'analysis', plenty of alcohol to stop people thinking critically, and you get the idea.

This, friends, is life inside a Trotskyist cult. My God, am I happy to be free of it."

Calling it an effort to hold prosecutors and judges accountable, the NXIVM members additionally plan to launch a podcast, hold a $35,000 “Innocence Challenge” and gather signatures on a petition that was already signed by supporters such as Knox, an American exchange student targeted by Italian authorities for the murder of her roommate in a case that attracted international attention.

“It’s absurd in so many ways that I don’t know where to begin,” attorney Neil Glazer, who represents victims of NXIVM in a civil suit filed earlier this year, told the Times Union in an email on Sunday. “I’ve never seen anything like this bizarre document in all my years of legal practice.""

Circle of Hope is a cult like boarding school (not at all a school) and had been sexually, mentally, emotionally and physically abusing young girls since 2006.

#  The Chanting Millions   

###  BBC/October 14, 1995    By Julian Pettifer  

 Narration as follows:  

In the year we commemorate the allied victory over Japan and the  terrible atrocities it revealed, we are again reminded that this is a  land of puzzling contradictions. As well as ornate temples and pastoral  calm, and mysticism, and pacifism, there are sudden eruptions of extreme  violence.  

When, this year, poison gas was released into the Tokyo subway,  the shocking suspicion emerged that it was done by a religious cult that  claims its roots in Buddhism. It was in the foothills of Japan's sacred  Mt. Fuji that the Aum-Shinrikyo sect that stands accused of a  gas-attack trained its followers. It was in Buddhist Teachings and in  The Book of Revelation, grossly perverted and corrupted, the  justification was somehow found for mass-murder. That is the charge that  faces the charismatic leader of Aum, Shoko Asahara, when he shortly  goes on trial.  

The Aum-case raises many concerns that have come up in foreign  relation to other cults around the world. But it also poses questions  that are peculiar to Japan. Above all, the Aum case calls into question  of law the status and the influence of the vast number of other  religious groups. Believe it or not, in Japan, today, there are roughly  241,000 officially registered religious organizations. Most of them are  very small, but some are big and powerful. But with ten million  followers, is by far the biggest, Soka Gakkai.  

### Soka Gakkai Activities

Soka Gakkai is much more than a religious organization. It's a wide  spread social and political movement, highly disciplined, some say  dangerous. Head of Soka Gakkai since 1960 is Daisaku Ikeda.  

Ikeda is the great cultural and, for his supporters, spiritual leader. Another view says he's a bully with a lust for power.  

INTERVIEW WITH IKEDA: I'm a common, serious-minded man. The  mass-media ..., with the exception of the BBC, make up this image of me  as a dictator, and so forth. This troubles me.  

Common men, however serious, do not find themselves as Mr. Ikeda  frequently does, in the company of international elite that includes the  likes of Mrs.Thatcher. He's frequently photographed with royalty, prime  ministers and presidents. When president Mandella came recently to  Japan on a state visit, his only private audience was with Mr. Ikeda.  Why is a man who has never held public office found in such company? He  has access to great wealth, but is that enough? Since powerful people  seek the company of other powerful people, what does that tell us about  Mr. Ikeda?  

INTERVIEW WITH POLITICAL COMMENTATER MR. MINORU MORITA: I don't think anyone has more power in Japan than Ikeda. No one.  

FOUNDATION OF IKEDA'S POWER -- TAISEKIJI-TEMPLE OF NICHIREN SHOSHU  

This is the foundation of Mr. Ikeda's power. S.G. was the lay-  organization founded to support Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, a 700 year-old  sect. These followers of a 13th century Japanese monk, are considered  heretical by main-stream Buddhist's.  

Central to their belief is the power of chanting, that by the  invocational recitation of the words ""Nam'-myo-ho-ren-ge-kyo"" almost anything can be achieved. S. G. took  these ancient simple beliefs and marketed them with astounding success.  It may look spiritual, but S.G. is all about practical things. That  includes personal wealth and political power. It's in Japan's cities  that Soka Gakkai gained most of its support. In the post war years, it  grew rapidly, and it's thought to have had special appeal for a defeated  and disillusioned generation. The faithful are expected to chant daily,  to donate generously to Soka Gakkai funds, and to recruit new members.  

INTERVIEW WITH S.G. MEMBERS IN KAWASAKI CITY, SOUTH OF TOKYO  

In the city of Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, Soka Gakkai has devoted  support from the Umezawa family, who own a small chain of beauty  parlors. Apart from the father of the family, all the others, son,  daughters and inlaws are in the business. First to join Soka Gakkai was  Mrs. Umezawa. Not only she converted the rest of the family, but between  them, they've introduced 112 other families to the practice of daily  chanting. Now retired Mr. Umezawa sometimes chants for 5 hours a day. He  and his family have no doubt that the growth of their business and  other good fortune is entirely due to regular practice of this ritual.  They faithfully pay their dues to Soka Gakkai, and according to Mrs.  Umezawa, their loyalty and their chanting is rewarded.  

MRS. YOSHIE UMEZAWA: We were always short of money. Although we  worked very hard, things were tough. Now we travel abroad without any  financial difficulty.  

It's not only to make money that the Umezawas practice their daily chanting.  

MR. TADASHI UMEZAWA: When my wife was pregnant, we talked about  an abortion because I didn't want any more daughters. Soka Gakkai  members told me that if I practiced hard, we might have a son. We  chanted, and as a result, we had a son!  

No doubt, Soka Gakkai has many satisfied members. But some feel  betrayed, sensing that their loyalty, and their money, and their votes  have been exploited to serve the political ambitions of Mr. Ikeda. He  founded his own political party in 1964, and although it's been  partially dissolved, suspicions remain, some of them, expressed at this  protest meeting of former Soka Gakkai members.  

KEIGO OUCHI (Member of Parliament at a meeting of AVSG -  Association of Victims of Soka Gakkai): Mr. Ikeda often says he will  take over Japanese politics and become the real leader of the  Government.  

Although Soka Gakkai has taken steps to sever former links with  its political party, it still commands a block vote to use as it wishes.  

INTERVIEW WITH POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, MR. MINORU MORITA: Soka Gakkai is able to mobilize 6 million votes. These 6 million votes  represent more than ten per cent of the electorate. Mr. Ikeda, as the  head of S.G. has a strong influence over the political world.  

Of 700 disgruntled former members here (at the meeting), many complain of how Soka Gakkai extracted money from them.  

HIROHISA MASUDA (Former S.G. member): In 1982, when my  grandfather died and we inherited his property, members of Soka Gakkai  came, repeatedly, and demanded contributions. They wanted 10 million yen  (U.S. $100,000). In the end we gave them 5 million yen.  

Of course, Soka Gakkai justifies all of its money raising activities.  

INTERVIEW WITH IKEDA: We want to promote a good religion.  Religion is a metaphysical concept, but it needs to be advertised like  any good product.  

ADVERTISEMENT OF SOKA GAKKAI (S.G.I. PR video-tape): Soka Gakkai  has gloriously embarked on its voyage toward the 70th anniversary of its  founding. The Soka family throughout the world will continue to advance  cheerfully and harmoniously in its Kosen-Rufu activities day and night,  widening the current of Buddhism among the people throughout the  universe, heralding the era of peace and freedom.  

Yes, Soka Gakkai is now international. In the U.K. this is its  lavish headquarters used by some 8,000 members. But in the U.S. and  notably in California, Soka Gakkai has greater success, claiming some  150,000 adherents. But it's also been much criticized and even  classified as a dangerous cult.  

FRANK ROSS (Former S.G.I. leader): I think by anybody's  definition of a cult, if someone's life is completely controlled by an  individual or an organization, that would certainly fit into the  category of a cult. When I was in S.G.I., I would have died for Ikeda.  And I know hundreds of people that felt the same way.  

AL ALBERGATE (SGI-USA Public relations director): I reject  categorically the idea that we are a dangerous cult, because to me that  would imply a pseudo religion that exists mainly to take advantage of  people, whether financially or psychologically, and I know in my 28  years in the organization, we have never done that.  

In America too, there are certainly satisfied customers. Among  the affluent, who have seaside homes at Malibu, are those who believe  that chanting has brought them health, wealth and happiness, and spread  the word among their friends and neighbours.  

NEIL STEVENS (S.G.I. member) (Note: At a discussion meeting): I'd  like to welcome everyone. We're going to chant, what we call morning  evening gongyo...  

Neil Stevens is an investment banker. He and his wife, Lynn, hold  weekly meetings, where they introduce new comers to the practice of  chanting.  

(Scene of members chanting.)  

For some newcomers, chanting in a foreign tongue seems odd. (Shot  of woman sitting on couch at meeting, rolling her eyes as she looks on  in disbelief, looking as if she wants to bolt out the door any second.)  But believers are keen to extol the reward and the enlightenment it  brings.  

INTERVIEW WITH MR. AND MRS.STEVENS:  

LYNN: (Gushing tears) I thank, I thank everyday, the girl that  introduced this practice to me, 'cause it changed my life. I have such a  beautiful husband, a beautiful daughter. When I had, lost three little  babies....and I had such, uh, oh, I don't know...I had so much fortune,  but yet, that doesn't guarantee that you are going to be happy. And I  was able to, ummm, uh tap into the joy in my life, and change such  poison into medicine, and make all my dreams come true, and I really  have.  

NEIL: (Tears smeared on his face) So then Katy's got me going on  this doing the Nam-myo-ho-ren-ge-kyo thing, and, uhh, it really  empowered me to create, uhh, pretty much my business dream, the  beginning of it, anyway, and, uhh, really helped us push it through,  uhh, when we had, you know, tremendous obstacles.  

AL ALBERGATE: The actual practice of Buddhism is very accessible  to everybody. Because there's a very simple formula and a daily  practice, plus the idea that you tap so directly into your Buddha  nature, your life condition, that you can actually see results in your  daily life.  

DIANE HONEYMAN-BLOEDIE (Former S.G.I. member): It turned my life into a living hell, basically. I was miserable!  

INTERVIEWER: Why principally?  

DIANE: Mostly because of my husband. They manipulated my husband  into becoming a totally different person. He was not the person I fell  in love, and married, and wanted to spend the rest of my life with. He  became totally obsessed; was never home. They had him going 24 hours a  day. And he was hell to live with.  

AL ALBERGATE: If we put pressure on each other, it was only so  that we could, duh, move forward and advance as a religious organization  in this country it was not..., primary, our idea was never to take  people's money.  

DIANE HONEYMAN-BLOEDIE: As I was walking out the building, one of  the ""Women's Division leaders said, ""Did you make a contribution  today?"" and I said, ""No, I don't have any money to make a contribution. I  have 5 dollars in my purse"" (She said), ""You should give that $5."" (I  said,) ""It's Tuesday. I don't get paid until Friday. I have to buy  milk."" She said, ""If you give the $5 today, it'll come back to you in a  much bigger way."" So I said, ""So you're telling me, I shouldn't buy milk  for my 18 month old daughter and I should give the $5 to you?"" and she  said, ""Yeah."" and I said, ""No.""  

AL ALBERGATE: Some of our members and leaders, although sincere,  were over-zealous. And, basically, about 5 years ago, we just put an end  to most specific targets and just decided that the best way to go was  to just help people practice Buddhism, and as their own personal  circumstances improve in society, as they feel appreciation for this  Buddhism, then they will donate.  

DIANE HONEYMAN-BLOEDIE: We're their little worker bees. We're  collecting all their little money, all their little honey for them, and  we gladly give it over. You know, I just... My feeling was that they  just think we're stupid. And if we're promised that we can get anything  we want, that if we can get instant gratification, which is sort of the  American way, we're gonna go for it. So that's how they pass it off. You  want a car? Chant! You want a better job? Chant! You want more money?  Chant!  

INTERVIEWER (to Al): It occurs to me that one of the attractions,  perhaps, of your particular type of Buddhism is that it does promise  practical benefits.  

AL ALBERGATE: That's correct. And I think that's very attractive  to many people. Maybe more so Americans. We're sort of, err, an instant  microwave kind of culture, and I'm sure that appeals to many, I know it  appeals to many people.  

INTERVIEWER: Is it somewhat dangerous, though, that if you expect  it to work miracles in your life, that if you expect the Porche  tomorrow, that you're going to be disappointed, and that you may think  the religion has failed you?  

AL ALBERGATE: Yes, that's true. It is a problem if we don't take  the time to help people really study the profundity of Buddhism and to  understand it's not about Porsches and cars and things like that. These  are nice incidentals that might come your way as a result of a higher  life condition and your increased ability to work and perform your daily  life. But we have to teach that, after all, the idea is to become an  enlightened human being, with or without a nice car.  

FRANK ROSS: People are approached from the standpoint of doing  something for their personal lives, and, little by little, they are told  that the only way they can advance their personal lives is to advance  the organization. Once you've made that connection, that advancing the  organization is advancing your personal life, then they have total  control over you. So, watching the people who have been abused over time  and just fleeced, you know, year in and year out for money, that  certainly is a horrible form of abuse.  

INTERVIEWER: But you were one of the abusers?  

FRANK ROSS: Yes, I certainly was. But at that time, I didn't  realize that it was abuse. I was part of that operation, and we thought  that no matter what people did for the organization, it would be good  for them.  

If that's the way it is in the United States, how much greater is the money making machine in Japan?  

Soka Gakkai means ""value creating society"" and essentially it  peddles another one of those familiar ""Samuel Smile's Recipes For  Self-improvement."" While other philosophies suggest the ultimate values  of ""truth"" and ""goodness,"" Soka Gakkai contends that happiness lies also  in profit, and it's something the organization itself is very good at.  

PROF. HIROHISA KITANO (Professor of law at Nihon University):  Nobody knows actually how rich Soka Gakkai is. Experts estimate Soka  Gakkai has more than 1,000 properties throughout Japan with total assets  of more than 10,000 billion yen (125 billion U.S. dollars).  

In the wake of the Kobe earthquake, S.G. used its money raising  skills to great effect. Special appeals were launched and Soka Gakkai  membership responded with extra donations, on top of those they  routinely make. More than a dozen fund raising drives have supported  U.N. relief activities for refugees, and numerous exhibitions have been  mounted to promote Mr. Ikeda's good works.  

DAISAKU IKEDA: Religion can be compared to mother earth. We must  cultivate the earth in order to bring forth plants and flowers. The  promotion of peace, education, and culture is a fundamental role for  religion.  

This is the Tokyo Soka Elementary school, part of an integrated  system of private schools ranging from kindergarten to university,  founded by Daisaku Ikeda. Today, the children celebrate the Tanabata  Festival. These are the wish trees decked out with wish paper streamers.  Each one carrying a child's wishes and dreams. Almost all of the  children are from Soka Gakkai families.  

HIDETO IIJIMA (Soka Elementary School, 2nd grade): I am Hideto  lijima, a second-year pupil. I want to become a millionaire so that I  can help the poor by giving them my money.  

Like the elementary school, the Soka High School is four times  over-subscribed. No religion is taught here. But the children are  certainly well versed in the achievements and importance of their  school's founder, Mr. Ikeda.  

MITSUKO YAKANI (Soka High School student): He has a philosophy  based on humanism for the education. He is also a poet, and he is like, I  feel very warm meeting him. He's like, I feel like he's like my father.  

DAIGO KURAISUKO (Soka High School student): If you compare,  compared to other schools, I found my friends, friends much brighter,  and...  

INTERVIEWER: Much brighter? Really?  

DAIGO KURAISUKO: Brighter. Yes. And...they know why they're studying. Because they have dream.  

Mr. Ikeda's biggest and most powerful dream machine is another  one of his creations. Seikyo Shimbun, Soka Gakkai's newspaper, is part  of a large publishing empire, and has a daily circulation of 5,500,000.  It's virtually compulsory reading for Soka members, as it carries a  regular column by the leader, as well as promoting, in its own words,  the movement for peace and culture. The paper is extremely profitable,  making more than 60 million pounds a year. It has its own special view  of the world and is not averse to tidying up the picture to match the  Soka version of reality.  

From the cradle to the grave, Soka Gakkai cares for its members.  In a country of many religions, it's always been the Buddhists of Japan  who have looked after the ""here-after."" This has worked very much to the  financial benefit of Soka Gakkai. In partnership with the Mitsubishi  Bank, a country- wide chain of cemeteries has been constructed, complete  with piped Mozart, and with thousands of plots, all of them sold.  

In Japan, it's believed that the spirits of the ancestors care  for the living, and so strong emotional bonds are expressed in the way  the living remember and treat the dead. This means there's great  pressure to purchase a suitable and expensive memorial, and to tend it  diligently.  

This deep sense of duty to the ancestors appears to be useful to Soka Gakkai in its dealings with members and employees.  

JIRO OSHIKO (Former S.G. official): I was forced to buy a  cemetery plot in Hokkaido (The northern-most island of Japan). I live in  Ohmiya, a suburb of Tokyo. So, there was no need to buy a cemetery plot  in a remote place like the island of Hokkaido. I was not allowed to pay  for the plot in cash. I was, to some extent, coerced to take out a loan  with Mitsubishi Bank. The bank calculated my monthly payments. And, in  the end, I think I finished up having to pay twice the normal amount.  

PROF. KITANO: The Mitsubishi Group is a major (business) concern.  Before the war, Mitsubishi was even more powerful. Today the Mitsubishi  Bank is Soka Gakkai's main bank. There are strong ties between them.  

An investigation into Soka Gakkai's gravestone business was  triggered by the discovery of the yen equivalent of 1.2 million (U.S.)  dollars in a safe discarded in a scrap yard.  

PROF. KITANO: A top member of Soka Gakkai said it was his own,  personal money, and that it had no connection with Soka Gakkai. The tax  office thought it strange, and they started a full-scale investigation.  

MINORU MORITA (Political Commentator): Contributions to Japanese  religious organizations are not subject to either taxation or  inspection. They are free to collect and spend money as they choose.  

In the shadow of Mt.Fuji, there is spectacular evidence of how  Soka Gakkai spent some of its vast wealth. They constructed here a  complex that included halls, guest houses, shrines, and a structure  that's the largest temple in Asia, and possibly the largest in the  world. This is where the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood tended to the  spiritual needs of the Soka Gakkai faithful. But not any longer,  following a long running power struggle between Ikeda and the  priesthood. He and the entire Soka Gakkai membership were  excommunicated. Since 1992, the temple has been off limits, and the war  of words continues.  

REV. KOGAKU AKIMOTO (Nichiren-Shoshu Bureau of Religious  Affairs): Our High Priest had talks with (gave guidance to) Soka Gakkai.  They refused to change their ways, and we had to excommunicate them.  

DAISAKU IKEDA: They mercilessly excommunicated us without any  real reason. Simply because they had enough money and no longer needed  us. There has been no worse incident in Buddhist history than this. They  treated the believers like slaves. It was like religion in medieval  times.  

INTERVIEWER: And you see yourself like Luther, reforming the church and bringing it away from the corruption of Rome?  

DAISAKU IKEDA: Yes, it's the same thing. History is repeating itself. It's just like Luther. I am proud of it.  

Mr. Ikeda's role as a thinker, rivaling Martin Luther, is  enhanced by Soka University, which he founded in 1971, which is now  regarded as one of Japan's more successful seats of learning, and one of  the fastest growing. It's already linked to a sister campus in  California, and soon to be joined by a second. Thanks to lavish  endowment, the pangs of recession have scarcely been felt here. The  department of bio- engineering has recently opened and a new building  program will make room for more faculties and departments that feature  in the founder's vision of the future. In the university prospectus is a  fullsome account of the founders life and works, pointing out that he  has tirelessly devoted his life to promoting peace, culture and  education by establishing numerous cultural and educational  institutions. It also lists his honorary doctorates and professorships  from around the world -- over 40 of them, and his national decorations,  and other major awards, and major publications in English. There's also a  translation of the founding spirit of the university, penned, of  course, by Mr. Ikeda. -- ""Be the highest seat of learning for humanistic  education, be the cradle of a new culture, be the fortress for the  peace of mankind.""  

One of Ikeda's major publications in English is titled ""Choose Life.""  

It's a dialogue with the late Arnold J. Toynbee, distinguished British historian, and grandfather of Polly Toynbee.  

POLLY TOYNBEE (Journalist): It's hard to imagine here, but the  name ""Toynbee,"" in Japan, is still extraordinarily influential. Not just  in the academic world and in the political world, but the students  still read his books, because he is this prophet of the rise of the  Pacific Basin and the power of the Pacific.  

STEVE GORE (Former SGI employee): Ikeda went to London, England  to have a series of dialogues with a noted British historian, ArnoId  Toynbee, and we were part of the entourage traveling in a capacity as a  liaison agent, but also in the ever presence, our job was to jump on a  bomb, or in front of a bullet, or in front of a knife in case this man  was attacked by some fanatical, unhappy person.  

DAISAKU IKEDA: Dr. Toynbee welcomed me like his own son. Our  talks were intense and at a very high Ievel. We had to change  interpreters twice.  

For the Soka faithful, the book is almost Holy Writings. Years  after Prof. Toynbee's death, and to their great surprise, Polly Tynbee  and her husband were invited to visit Mr. Ikeda in Japan.  

POLLY TOYNBEE: Everything that we did was formal; huge, formal  gatherings; meetings, with different people; meetings with the women of  Soka Gakkai; meetings with different groups, people associated in their  minds with my grandfather in some way or another, and we found it very  oppressive; very alarming; and certainly by the time it came to the  meeting with him, by then we had formed a very clear idea of this  extraordinary, militarily run organization. Phenomenal power, wealth,  and a sinister level of obedience.  

INTERVIEWER: Did you get any impression of Ikeda, ""the great spiritual leader""?  

POLLY TOYNBEE: I think it would be hard to imagine a less  spiritual man. He was in every way earthy. A powerful megalomania; we  got this aura of power from him that was extremely alarming. We then  went, on another day with him, to some huge Nuremberg style rally in a  stadium, where everything was to the greater worship of him. And again,  what he really liked was this feeling of power.  

Power and the trappings of power. This palace is the Japanese  government's official guest house, where its most important visitors are  housed. Recently, the press was summoned here for a photo-call to  witness the presentation to Pres. Nelson Mandela of an honorary degree  by Daisaku Ikeda. Throughout the ceremony, Mr.Ikeda appeared to be on  the most intimate terms with the distinguished visitor.  

DAISAKU IKEDA: We first met five years ago. It was a very warm  occasion. He had read my book in jail. He said we should foster our  friendship for the rest of my life.  

POLLY TOYNBEE: What he did with my grandfather he has done time  and time again with distinguished people all over the world, who haven't  a clue who he is, or what he is, and just imagine that he is an  important and serious Japanese leader. And so they agree to have a  meeting with him, and out of perhaps one meeting comes the impression  that it's a very close and important relationship, and that this person  has given their full support to Ikeda and his movement.  

As founder of Soka-University, Mr. Ikeda has been able to confer  honorary degrees on many of Japan's most eminent visitors. When Mr.  Gobechav was so rewarded, it was another splendid opportunity with Ikeda  at center stage -- friend of the powerful and patron of the arts.  

Among Ikeda's more grandiose ventures in his cultural crusade is  the establishment of two major museums of art. This one (Tokyo Fuji Art  Museum) houses 5,000 works, including paintings by many of the greatest  European masters, from all the principle periods and schools, up to the  present day. Although there are fine paintings here, experts regard it  as a curiously mixed bag, which may be explained, in part, by the way it  was put together. When Mr. Ikeda went shopping in the art galleries of  Europe, he didn't waste time on second thoughts or second opinions.  

STEVE GORE: The rapidness at which Ikeda would walk through the  galleries impressed me. He would spend maybe 4 to 6 minutes in each  gallery. He would point and utter these commands. The names of the  works, the prices and the catalog, everything was written down. Several  hours later, one of the general secretaries would come back with the  briefcase full of money. If the man was willing to meet for the bulk  price - - the 3, 4 or 6 pieces from his gallery -- he was given the  cash. I found it amazing to see how fast one man could spend so much  money.  

Very serious questions have been asked on how so much money was  spent on certain works of art, and where the money went. Here at the  Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, negotiations allegedly took place, in 1989, for  the purchase of two French impressionist paintings that are now in the  Soka Gakkai collection. Tax authorities became suspicious, because both  Soka Gakkai and Mitsubishi claimed to have purchased the same paintings,  on the same day, in the same place, but at a different price.  

Tax investigators could find no trace of two French nationals who  supposedly sold the two Renoir paintings to Mitsubishi. It appears to  have been a double sale of the paintings in which 11 million (U.S.)  dollars went astray -- simply disappeared.  

Japanese newspapers suggest that the money probably finished-up  in a political ""slush-fund,"" and that Soka Gakkai is more interested in  pedaling political influence than it is in French impressionism.  

DAISAKU IKEDA: Our museum bought the Renoir masterpieces for a  very high price, but I knew nothing about it. If there is a scandal,  people always blame me.  

No one was really made the scape-goat, although the authorities  raided the premises of art dealers to discover who did sell the  paintings, and to whom. And although they confiscated documents, and  although Mitsubishi was ticked- off for dealing in antiques without a  license, and although inquiries went on for months by official agencies  and the press, nothing was resolved.  

PROF. KITANO: Without finding what happened to the money, the  Japanese tax office stopped their investigation. We believe that this  was the result of strong political pressure by Soka Gakkai.  

DAISAKU IKEDA: They can say or write what they like. They won't  imprison me, or kill me with poison-gas. But I am concerned at the way  the mass media becomes emotional and prejudiced. This can hinder  democracy and human rights.  

To make sure that its members are not corrupted by hostile media,  Soka Gakkai has its own communications network to spread the word to  1,000 meeting halls and cultural centers. This can be of great value  when it comes to election time.  

Last year, Soka Gakkai's own party, Komei, was partially merged  to form a new party, Shinshin-to (New Frontier Party \[NFP\]). Recently,  elections for the Upper House were the first real test of its strength.  The voter turn-out was the lowest in recent history, benefiting the  party that could best deliver the votes. The results sent shock-waves  through the political circles, with the new party winning 40 seats,  thanks to the Soka Gakkai vote, and that must have profound implications  for Mr. Ikeda.  

INTERVIEWER: As Shinshin-to, it must stand a reasonable chance, does it not, of being actually elected and forming a government?  

IKEDA: I am placed in a very difficult position. If I say yes,  then people might slacken their efforts. If I say no, some people may  lose confidence. And so, I must say, maybe yes, and maybe no.  

PROF. KITANO: Although Soka Gakkai calls itself a religious body,  in reality, it's Ikeda's political organization. Ikeda's aim is to use  Soka Gakkai to take over Japanese politics and the civil service.  

If we conclude from all the evidence that Soka Gakkai is not  quite the great force for peace and harmony and human happiness that it  claims to be, does that really matter except to a number of hurt and  angry individuals? For surely, the Aum- Shinrikyo case tells us that it  does matter. What that bizarre story reveals is a dangerous weakness in  the Japanese Constitution that leaves it virtually powerless to deal  with the religious organizations. The constitution imposed on Japan by  the United States, at the end of World War II, guarantees freedom from  state interference with religious groups, and that provision protects  their tax exempt status. Now, unless changes are made to the law, they  will continue to use, or misuse, their great wealth as they will.  Changes to the Religious Corporation Law could check the secret use of  funds that, in the Aum-Shinrikyo case, were used to develop chemical  weapons. Such reforms are now before Japan's legislatures. If they  become law, they could curb the power of all religious groups, including  Soka Gakkai.  

In a recent development, Japan's Justice Minister announced his  resignation following allegations that in a secret deal with the  opposition, Shinshin-to party, he would agree to obstruct his own  government's efforts to make religious organizations more accountable.  The name of Soka Gakkai, through its support of Shinshin-to is bound to  be linked to the scandal.  

The Japanese public is well aware that if recent election results  are repeated in a general election, Shinshin-to could take the reign of  the government. And where then, would the real power lie? """

By AMY PYLE                                               Dec. 16, 1991 12 AM

""The  conflict between Japan’s largest Buddhist sect and its powerful  lay  organization has reverberated through the Southern California-based   U.S. wing of the Soka Gakkai, according to former and current members of   the group.

Earlier this year,  when the split became evident, the  U.S. organization, which is based on  Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica,  distanced itself from the priests  of the Nichiren Shoshu sect by  changing its name from Nichiren Shoshu  of America to SGI-USA (short for  Soka Gakkai International-USA).

With  the split have come widespread rumors within the Soka Gakkai,   including reports that members are not being welcomed at the Nichiren   Shoshu temples and that, in order to enter, visitors must renounce their   Soka Gakkai allegiance.

But Mike  Robbins, manager of the Myohoji  Temple in Rancho Cucamonga, said  “anyone who is practicing Nichiren  Shoshu Buddhism continues to be  welcome here at the temple.”

In  the wake of Soka Gakkai’s excommunication by Nichiren Shoshu, a group   of disgruntled Soka Gakkai members in Northern California are   contemplating taking legal action against the organization for allegedly   taking their money fraudulently. They maintain that they were never   informed of the frictions between the religion and its lay organization.   They had donated tens of thousands of dollars for a new religious   cultural center and parking garage in the belief that the two would   remain linked.

Some former members of the Soka Gakkai have heard that the lay organization is giving out used  *gohonzon,*    or prayer scrolls, to new members instead of returning them to the  head  temple in Japan for destruction or storage. That report has been  denied  by the SGI-USA.

The  *gohonzons,*   considered an integral  part of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, are supposed  to be bestowed on new  members by Nichiren Shoshu priests at an  initiation ceremony. The  scrolls are normally returned to the priests  when people die, marry or  leave the sect.

SGI-USA  spokesman Al Albergate--former spokesman for the Los Angeles  district  attorney’s office--said last week that he had been told by Soka  Gakkai  members that only those who denounce their Soka members were  being  issued new  *gohonzon.*

'We’ve been preparing people to practice without the  *gohonzon*  for at least awhile,' he said.

The  dispute in Japan also caused members and former members of the  Soka  Gakkai in this country to more openly question the motives of the   organization’s various offshoots in their past attempts to disassociate   themselves from the main group. Disaffected members say, and documents   indicate, that the offshoots have long been clearly connected to each   other and to the Soka Gakkai.

Representatives  of Soka University  of America, a nonprofit organization that wants to  build a  4,500-student, four-year college in the Santa Monica Mountains  near  Calabasas, have repeatedly insisted during interviews and public   hearings that the school is independent from the Soka Gakkai and its   U.S. wing. The school’s expansion proposal has drawn criticism from   nearby residents and state and federal parks officials, who want the   land for a national park headquarters.

Similar claims of independence have  been made by other Soka  Gakkai-related groups, including the American  branch of the group, Soka  Gakkai International-USA, and the Nichiren  Shoshu Sokagakkai of Canada,  which has proposed a controversial  educational and religious conference  center outside Toronto.

Yet  tax and land transaction documents filed in the United States and   Canada, plus interviews and information supplied by the groups   themselves, indicate that all are closely related.

George  Williams, general director of Soka Gakkai  International-USA--known as  the Nichiren Shoshu of America (NSA) until a  few months ago--is named  prominently in documents filed by other  groups. Williams was listed as  founding director of the Nichiren Shoshu  Sokagakkai of Canada (NSC) and  the first chief administrative officer of  Soka University of America  in tax-related documents obtained from the  Internal Revenue Service and  from its Canadian counterpart, Revenue  Canada.

Williams  and NSA also are listed in Los Angeles County deeds as  coordinators of  the purchase of the original 248 acres of Soka  University of America  property. The Calabasas school now holds classes  for about 100 students  from Soka University in Japan, most of whom are  Soka Gakkai members.  During a tour last spring,  *gongyo,*  the religion’s form of chanting, was listed twice daily on a dormitory schedule.

 Enclosed  in tax returns filed this year was a new list of 11 Soka  University  officers, directors and trustees, which the school’s  representatives  point to as evidence of their independence."" 

If the name SGI is new to you, that's because prior to 1991, it was known broadly as Nichiren Shoshu Sokagakkai, however the last part of the name depended on the country.  Like NSA (Nichiren Shoshu of America), NSUK (Nichiren Shoshu of UK), etc."
cults,j01fi7,Our cult has broken into a new/seperate branch... and it's a huge change,"I have been apart of a small ""cult"" as much as we hate using that word, it's the only label I can give.  We do not harm, and we do not believe in expression through violence.  But at one point, a few members have taken it WAY too far, and it slowly drove into some illegal activities that have been taken care of by local law.  After multiple other issues we have broke out into a separate ""branch""

As they took our beliefs too far, we are trying our hardest to seperate ourselves from them around here, we have had to go into small investigations and it has been a new aura around our town, but of course we haven't done anything wrong and thankfully the law understands that as well.

I know this is completely random, and you have no idea what is fully being mentioned, but since I find interest in some of the content on this subreddit, I thought I'd give a piece of recent information out, that way if I plan to make future posts regarding us and/or the issues that follow along, you can have an understanding as to some of our struggles."

It was around the same time, as when Mary said the word “manifested,” to me, when I was also asking her questions, specifically about where she lives.  But before that -okay, well, the second question I ever asked Mary, was where she lived: specifically, like, what dimension, or realm.  She answered, “5D.""  I confirmed with her, by usage of a yes or no question, that “D”, stood for dimension.  So, she said that she lives in the fifth dimension.  Shortly after that, I don't remember exactly why though, she spelled out the message for me, “I am here and there.”  I definitely remember that that was written on a manila envelope.  Later, after I started using a notebook to write down my data, she also spelled it out many times, the message, ""I am here and there.""  At the time when I was writing that down, I didn't think much of it.  However, a couple of months later, Mary again said, ""I am here and there.""  So I asked her, ""Here and where.""  She responded, ""5th demension.""  I confirmed with her by use of a yes or no question that she meant, dimension.  Then I asked her if she is in the third and fifth dimension at the same time.  She answered, ""Yes.""  Guessing from that and later communications, it seems that as well as living in the fifth dimension, and visits the third dimension, and apparently, she is in both places at the same time when she does that.

Like those leaving cults, some people who believe in conspiracy theories like QAnon and Pizzagate can break free from their beliefs.

"" ... Recently, QAnon has gotten a great deal of attention in the media due to QAnon-promoting congressional candidates such as Republican nominees Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, thus bringing the theory mainstream. It has also been linked to violence, such as the 2019 shooting of a Staten Island mob boss by a QAnon supporter and a Texas woman attacking two strangers with her car earlier this year because she believed them to be child traffickers. President Trump has refused to overtly discredit or reject QAnon ideology, to the delight of believers, whose primary goal is to win Trump’s attention.

'They desperately need a place to put their anger and a way to make sense of the world. Us versus them, the horrible bad guys, is something they all seem to cling to,' says cult expert Diane Benscoter, who has spoken to numerous people whose loved ones are involved in QAnon. 'The doctrine makes it easy to say, ‘Clearly we have to make a stand against this,’ and it feels really good to believe you’re on the side of righteousness and saving children.'""

I’m new here, not sure if this is the right place to go with this but I’m giving it a shot.

My brother was brainwashed 18 years ago or so by a conspiratorial group that enforced strict Christian doctrine. The reason I came is because most of the views of the group he is a part of are unlike any other.

They strongly believe in Christian ideals, specifically the Catholic Traditionalist Church. They believe Satan controls everyone’s thoughts, that anyone can be “taken over” at any time to combat their goals. So anyone who opposes them is dismissed as Satan.

My brother has been taking colloidal silver which his group believes cures all diseases and viruses. He has permanently tattooed his skin blue from the excess deposits of silver at microscopic levels. 

They have created shell companies, ran up their debt, and escaped to an island in the Caribbean where they have been holed up for 4 years. Recently they have been texting my parents, making us well aware that my brother is not in control, his leader speaks for him during any correspondence.

My parents hired a private investigator to make contact with him, and the leader spoke oh his behalf. It was discovered that their Visa has expired and they will be deported and extridited to the USA.

My family is worried when my brother comes home that he was stay with this group and continue to be a plague on all of us financially and mentally. Does anyone know of any resources or professionals that could assist us? 

My brother is really far gone at this point, he also has in diagnosed schizophrenia that runs in the family, so with the mental illness and the fanatical beliefs he really went off the deep end. 

My parents are retired, getting older, and don’t have the faculties to handle this situation properly. My sister and myself are worried we will be responsible for my brother the rest of our lives unless we get a solution set in place now. Any help would be GREATlY appreciated.

The Church is led by Master John Douglas who is originally from Australia, and has been doing similar work for quite some time. The groups largest claim is the miracle of healing from angels and the ability to speak with angels, curing cancer etc. Headquartered in Boone, North Carolina the group stretches' all across the country. From my reading online so far I have only came across a few stories, one from a former employee whose boss was heavily involved with the church in Texas and seemed to blindly throwing huge amounts of money into the organization.

cults,iy6yd3,An interesting right handed interaction at work,"Okay so I work at a convient store/gas station in Maryland, and recently we've been having this woman come in who is a bit peculiar and particular. When she comes in she will usually buy a few goodies and always gets a single regular black and mild. The first time I checked her out at the register and handed her the cigar she asked me to hand it to her with my right hand (if I touch it with my left hand she doesn't make me get a new one or anything) and with the mouth piece of it facing her. Which I gladly obliged thinking nothing of it. But the more she has been coming in and interacting with my other coworkers the more she's become a bit of an issue. She ALWAYS asks for everything to be handed to her with the person's right hand and makes a huge stink about it if they don't. 

Today in particular she at one point walked in, and was holding her phone's speaker up to her ear playing some music that my coworkers and I could only describe as a track that would be played during the murder scene in a horror movie. After walking in she just stopped in front of the glass where we prepare food and just stared at my coworker  not moving for an uncomfortable amount of time. Eventually after having some issues with her and one of my managers asking her to leave the store she did it again just outside and staring down my coworker at the register. This, understanbibly unnerved my coworker.

Now most of us chalked this up to her having some kind of mental disorder, OCD possibly combined with some form of schizophrenia, however another coworker is in her senior year of getting her psychology degree and said she doesn't believe she is either of those based off of her interactions with her. 

I know a lot of orthodox religions (Christians, Catholics, Mormons, Islam, certain Hindu and Sikh sects) poo-poo at people being left hand dominate, but this seamed a bit more than that. 

As far as her garb that may have been religious, she always comes in with a white head scarf/wrap over the top of her head. It looks more like a turban then a hijab. I've described the look of it to friends (both Christians and Muslims) of mine who wear and know more about hijabs then I do and they all say it's almost certainly not any kind of hijab they've ever heard of/seen before. 

But I'm curious if any of y'all out there in the Reddit cult land may have any inkling if this description matched any cults you all know about. 

Tldr: strange woman with white turban looking head scarf comes into my store  plays slasher music, stares down my coworkers and is REALLY REALLY insistent on people handing her things with their right hand and in a very specific way. Any ideas on what cult/religion she may be in?"

cults,ixud4c,I think I briefly joined a cult (my experience as a member of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement),"I’ve been wanting to write about this for a while but I’ve been too nervous to. I still have two friends who are very much involved with USM so I’m trying my best to be vague.

I’m writing this now because I feel like people might flock to USM as the civil rights movement is revamping across the US and the BLM movement is gaining traction.

When I joined a few years ago I was excited to join a group of white people under the leadership of the African People’s Socialist Party. I also believed and still believe in the importance of paying reparations as a white person benefiting from white privilege and centuries of systemic racism. Naturally, I felt USM aligned with my views and my efforts to be actively anti-racist. But from the beginning I began to notice some red flags.

The members were very, almost over the top charismatic and expected you to be all in from the get go. This was challenging for me, it felt like you couldn’t really ask questions or get a feel for the movement and you were supposed to just jump in with both feet. 

The time commitment was enormous, and you were encouraged to give monthly reparations, but never really knew where your money was ultimately ending up and what it was being used for.

One time I was at a weekly meeting, and accidentally saw an email to leadership from my cities chapter stating that a member I knew personally was experiencing “disunion”. This terminology weirded me out and I took note of it.

Despite the red flags I stuck it out for a few more months, and ended up meeting Omali Yeshitela who we all referred to as “the chairman” and his right hand woman, Penny Hess. 

I finally left after Gazi Kodzo was removed from USM as Secretary General. The whole thing was sketchy and we were kind of just expected to accept that he was gone without really asking questions. USM did eventually release a PSA regarding his “expulsion” but it still felt weird, and I decided to take some steps back until I eventually left all together.

About a year ago I saw that Gazi Kodzo released 3 YouTube videos about why he left Uhuru, and the reasons he left were pretty disturbing. 

I guess my motivation for posting this is to open a dialogue and see what other people’s thoughts are on USM. Do you think USM is a cult? Have you ever considered joining or were you once a member? What are your thoughts?"
cults,ixuc1w,Exposing Circle Of Hope Ranch,
cults,ixt6dz,Chandra Om Cult,"The following is based on what I experienced and witnessed while studying with Chandra Om of Cary, North Carolina.

She goes by the name Chandra Om, Amber Nucatola, Amber Om. She uses other peoples names that are not her own. Often the made-up names and emails are used to berate, chastise, and manipulate for her advantage. She can recreate herself. Be aware.

She ran NC School of Yoga in Raleigh, North Carolina and Shanti Niketan Ashram in Cary, North Carolina. She was a student of Dharma Mittra. Chandra seemed kind and charming when I met her. As time went on some of her students would tell me how to act. ""Chandra likes this."" ""Chandra doesn't like this."" ""You're doing this incorrectly."" Later it would evolve into how things ""have to"" be. You never wanted to upset or disturb the ""guru"" / ""mother"" (Chandra).  

It was an odd arrangement but if you could pull off all of this ""selfless service"" you would evolve spiritually- maybe one day reaching enlightenment. It was understood that Chandra was enlightened. And if you couldn't understand what was going on it was only because you weren't ""enlightened"" yet.

If Chandra ever had an issue with you she'd tell someone (another student or her husband) and the person would go to you to show you the error of your ways. You would then apologize profusely for a total non-issue and go crawling back to Chandra promising to do better. I did this. Countless others did as well. Once Chandra felt you were a more secure bet, she'd berate, chastise and abuse you directly. I was physically, mentally, emotionally and financially abused.

She used free labor from her students to care for her school and then to remodel her ashram. Her students ran the school, then the ashram, gave yoga classes, workshops, teacher trainings all without salaries while she kept the profit. It was called ""karma yoga"" or selfless service to God. She used them to care for and improve the ashram which was a property in her own name which she sold in August 2020 for $137,000 more than she purchased it for. She mislead people and they thought they were donating to her non-profit, but the property was always in her own name, never in the non-profit's. She had her assistant raise funds and then had students physically construct a screen porch at her personal residence. Again, free labor to make her personal property more valuable.

She would have students do extreme diets, including fasts. She would deprive people of proper nourishment. She'd have people stay in seclusion. She'd tell people to break ties with friends or family. She'd make ridiculous requests and then  threaten students- often with something which would impact their own evolution or that of the community. ""If this doesn't happen, the ashram will close."" ""If this doesn't happen, people will commit suicide."" ""If this doesn't happen, you'll wind up like &lt;insert name of a person she considers a failure&gt;."" Chandra Om did not use physical chains, but her brainwashing, lies and manipulation were so powerful that it was unnecessary.

After years of abuse and emailed lies from her assistant and friend, ""Rebecca"" (who supposedly lived in upstate New York and worked painting ceramics) Chandra's students found out that it was all a lie. One of many they had been told. It was Chandra all along pretending to have an assistant.

She was extremely manipulative and controlling. She had a weird fascination with ""godsons"". She would align those children with her and would try to make them feel angry towards their parents. She attempted to control all aspects of students lives (diet, family, sex, job, shopping, free time). She would often pit people against one another- trying to divide families and friends so that she would be #1.  

She blatantly lied to students, family and friends. From seemingly unimportant things (""I'm out of town"") to bigger things (""So and so was deathly ill but was cured"" by a combination of natural cures and Chandra's mystical healing abilities supposedly)

Chandra Om lied to and abused yoga students and others. She used her power and peoples genuine search for spiritual evolution to control and manipulate them.  "

This is an example of the anticult movement called counter-cultists. These are groups which go after cults based on their own religious views such as Christians, Jews and Muslims.

They are motivated to ""expose"" and take down 'cults' based on their own ideological teachings, such as the teachings in the Bible against ""false prophets"".

I'm not saying they're lying. I'm saying that their motivation is primarily ideological, and knowing the ideological basis for people going after 'cults' is a good critical thinking point to keep in mind while reading their criticism of a religion different from their own.

This happens way more often than most people realize. This group at least lays out their ideological motivations up front.

Most counter cultists do not.

For more on the anticult movement, and its various pieces, see:

&gt;""The anti-cult movement is conceptualized as a collection of individuals and groups, whether formally organized or not, who oppose some new religious movements (or ""[cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult)""). This [countermovement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countermovement) has reportedly recruited participants from family members of ""cultists"", former group members (or [apostates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostates)), religious groups (including [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism) groups)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-5) and associations of health professionals.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-6) Although there is a trend towards globalization,[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-7) the social and organizational bases vary significantly from country to country according to the social and political [opportunity structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_structures) in each place.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-8)  
&gt;  
&gt;As with many subjects in the social sciences, the movement is variously defined. A significant minority opinion suggests that analysis should treat the secular anti-cult movement separately from the religiously motivated (mainly Christian) groups.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-10)  
&gt;  
&gt;The anti-cult movement might be divided into four classes:  
&gt;  
&gt;secular counter-cult groups;  
&gt;  
&gt;Christian evangelical counter-cult groups;  
&gt;  
&gt;groups formed to counter a specific cult; and  
&gt;  
&gt;organizations that offer some form of exit counseling.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-11)  
&gt;  
&gt;Most, if not all, the groups involved express the view that there are potentially deleterious effects associated with some new religious movements.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cult_movement#cite_note-12)""

I am struggling with figuring out how.
 I do grounding and shadow work but everything is still confusing and my thinking is fragmented. When i left the abuse i felt like a blank slate. I didnt know my gender and didnt understand eating or sleeping and a bunch of things. My senses were rewired that positive sensations wete interpeted as negative and pain was positive. My my language skills were destroyed and so was my inner voices ability to use it. I felt like i had amnesia and i still dont understand a lot of things about the way people are, but i think i mask it ok enough, even though that just makes it worse on me mentally.
 Its been 6 years and ive been transforming a lot this year specifically but, still each and every thought i form in my head still feels like theyre being controlled by someone else. I cant have a thought in my head without it causing stiffness and physical pain, and deep fear. Ive been doing a lot of mental exercises and trying to fix my sentence structuring but my perspectives on things still keep shifting all the time. I still feel buried confusion all the time

cults,iwdigh,Instagram cults / Illuminati?,"Hi all, just tonight I've stumbled upon something weird. As a little background I have 2 Instagram accounts, a public account were I share a GFX work and a personal account I keep for friends n such.

Regardless, tonight I was look through my requested follows. I have left a tonne of them as pending for ages. One of the accounts sporting a PFP of a man in a hat caught my eye. Upon opening the account I found an odd account,  the account has 5 post 800+ followers and is following 7000+ accounts. the posts consist of 3 with the same image of the same man  in the PFP and 2 of a house plant.

Obviously I found this confusing. on top of this the posts are all recent and the only comments are the account it self and have an ok amount of likes. the account has kept 5 different highlights story categories one name (Destaques - ill mention this again later) once again with the same image of the man. 

Could this be some sort of Bot?

Now to the illuminati stuff,

Looking at the followers of the account there is a wide range of accounts. from graphic designers to gaming pages. There are multiple accounts that have the same sort activity. with recent posts of the same picture and ridiculous follower counts. 

However there are a tonne that reference the illuminati and 666. multiple accounts having 666 in the name or having pictures of Baphomet in front of  pentagrams. these accounts are more odd than how I found this rabbit hole. there is multiple accounts showing insane amounts of money, or even what looks like cultural events. A lot of the accounts have imagery of what looks to be the letter G within a compass (like the mathematical one) on rings and engraved in walls. The accounts don't seem to have comments  or captions on their posts.

A lot more of the accounts show imagery of middle aged men in militaristic or ceremonial attire with gold embellishment, but taken from like a hire photographer of sorts. And others selling what looks to be fake scams promising cash flipping or bit connect style money making schemes (that went well as we know)

Thrown around in some of the accounts is the word masonic, from a quick google search it explains the compass  and the regalia of the men but I'm still miffed towards the situation 

One of the  accounts outside the illuminati stuff (I think, it has 444 in its username though) once again 5 posts this time of TikTok and gaming screenshots. This time in its highlights has the same title as the other  account we started with Destaques this time with a female Spiderman 3d model in the story. on their story it also has the same date as in one of the posts from the original account 15 De Set De 2020.

So I'm still a little weirded out by the situation, but I find this incredibly intriguing. I'm not sure if this is just some weird Insta botting a cult or just some edgy kids and I'm looking into this way too far. of all the weird stuff on Instagram this is by far the most odd experience I've had on the platform. Thankyou for reading though the bad formatting and giving me your time.  If anyone has an answer to the situation id gladly appreciate it .

&amp;#x200B;

(I also don't know if its ok to give out the account that lead me to this discovery in case its like the Logan  botting scandal that The right Opinion did a video on. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJOe2MCJp8&amp;ab\_channel=TheRightOpinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJOe2MCJp8&amp;ab_channel=TheRightOpinion) if it is ok and someone wants the account ill post the handle ty again)"

cults,iv6oic,Looking for follow-up on The Lord Our Righteousness Church,"I came across this BBC documentary last night, called ""The End of the World Cult,"" ([https://vimeo.com/134416313](https://vimeo.com/134416313)) about a small religious sect in New Mexico who were preparing for the end of the world on October 31, 2007. 

The leader, Michael Travesser, claimed to be the physical embodiment of God and used this power to sleep with his son's wife and actively groom young teenagers/sleep naked in bed with them. He was eventually convicted of sexual assault, although he was released from prison in 2016 because he got cancer (???).

ANYWAY - I'm looking for information on what happened to the children who are featured in this documentary: a young 14 year old boy named Matthew, his sister, and two other young teenage girls whose parents had left the cult but could not, for some reason, extract their children from it. At one point during the film, the children are taken by their parents from the compound, but eventually all of them come back to be with Michael, and one of their mothers even SIGNS AWAY HER LEGAL RIGHTS AS A PARENT to let Matthew and his sister stay with the cult??? 

While obviously brainwashed (one girl even says ""of course I'm brainwashed! Michael washed my brain of all the bad stuff and made it pure!""), they all seemed to be smart and sweet kids. I am very curious what ended up happening to them in the years after Michael's conviction. 

Anyone have any info on this?"

cults,iuqfkv,Is QAnon a cult?,"Let's apply Lifton's Criteria for a destructive mind control cult:  Be careful, because it's possible to stretch things to create a match, but be sure you don't stretch them to create a match with your own cult.  Most of us are in some kind of cult, because most of us refuse to believe they could ever be in one. This is referring to a Destructive Mind Control Cult.   Political slogans don't apply here, so let's get that out of the way.  So let's go!    


1. Milieu control. By what process does QAnon control us in this way?   
Control over all a person sees, hears, reads, writes (information control) creates conflicts in respect to individual autonomy.   

2. Mystical Manipulation.   
""Seeks to promote specific patterns of behavior and emotion in such a way that it appears to have arisen spontaneously from within the environment, while it actually has been orchestrated Totalist leaders claim to be agents chosen by God, history, or some supernatural force, to carry out the mystical imperative""    
What is the QAnon environment?    Who are the totalist leaders?  Who do they claim special powers from? What are the Mystical Imperatives? 
3. Demand for Purity.  ""The world becomes sharply divided into the pure and the impure, the absolutely good (the group/ideology) and the absolutely evil (everything outside the group) ● One must continually change or conform to the group ""norm"" ● Tendencies towards guilt and shame are used as emotional levers for the group's controlling and manipulative influences""  Since Q isn't a ""group"" that can be defined beyond people who read the same things, I'm not sure how this would apply.  Who are we meant to be more pure than?    

4. Confession     
""Sessions in which one confesses to one's sin are accompanied by patterns of criticism and self-criticism, generally transpiring within small groups with an active and dynamic thrust toward personal change"".   
What do Q followers confess, and to whom?  What personal change do we seek?
5. Sacred Science    
 ""The totalist milieu maintains an aura of sacredness around its basic doctrine or ideology, holding it as an ultimate moral vision for the ordering of human existence ● Questioning or criticizing those basic assumptions is prohibited.""    
What is the basic doctrine that is sacred to Q followers?  How are we prevented from criticizing or challenging anything Q says? 
6. Loading the Language.   
 ""The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliche (thought-stoppers) ● Repetitiously centered on all-encompassing jargon ● ""The language of non-thought"".   
What are examples of the Loaded Language Q users employ?  
7. Doctrine Over Person.    
""Every issue in one's life can be reduced to a single set of principles that have an inner coherence to the point that one can claim the experience of truth and feel it ● The pattern of doctrine over person occurs when there is a conflict between what one feels oneself experiencing and what the doctrine or ideology says one should experience  One is made to feel that doubts are reflections of one's own evil""    
What is the set of principles that Q followers must follow? How are Q followers shamed or guilt tripped for not following some yet unnamed set of principles?  

8. Dispensing of Existence.   
""Since the group has an absolute or totalist vision of truth, those who are not in the group are bound up in evil, are not enlightened, are not saved, and do not have the right to exist""    
 I hear this about myself from the Left all the time, that I am evil, stupid, and of course deplorable, but Q never spoke to me, and no follower of his ever said these things.  Just SJWs.     
What is the Q totalist vision of truth?  Where can we find examples of Q followers being shamed, or called names for not following the unnamed set of principles?"

I am now in therapy and properly medicated so I’m doing well with it. Over the summer I believe he had a depressive episode and now I believe that he’s having a manic episode. 
He was telling me about this church he joined called Antioch Community Church. I did a little research and found that it is considered a cult by many people including ex members. I will attach an article I found about it. [article ](https://medium.com/@jessica.cobaugh9/to-a-close-9c8ff0671b62) . He’s talking about how he believes that his diabetes is caused by a demon and it could be gone next week and he might not need his insulin anymore and I’m concerned that he’s going to stop taking his insulin. I also read about how the church believes that mental illness is demonic possession. 
Right now he doesn’t seem willing to listen to any reason. Our mom has said that she can’t deal with him anymore but I plan to continue to keep contact with him and my hope is to get him out of the cult. Any advice would be helpful."
cults,iukohs,How watching 'the Vow' on HBO made me reconsider the origin of the world's most influential religions,"For those of you who have not seen *the Vow* on HBO, it is positively mesmerizing. I won't ruin it, but it's a recent documentary on how a popular self-improvement program for people in the business world became the front for a sex cult. 

The narrative is told from the perspective of a few influential, long-term members of the group who slowly began to realize that the program which they had dedicated almost every facet of their lives to was not what it seemed. The story documents a charismatic leader, Keith Rainere, who created this program for self improvement, and recruits powerful people to help bolster and spread his message.

What strikes me most about Keith is that he is a genuinely sincere, intelligent person who seems very intent on understanding people at their core. The documentary records several personal interactions with Keith and his followers, and the dialogue is incredibly raw and private - you almost feel like a voyeur watching these conversations. There is nothing nefarious about the overall arching content of the program. It's very much centered around self-fulfillment and releasing the bonds of your own limitations. 

As I watched this documentary, it dawned on me that all of this - the content of the program NXIVM, the complete and total dedication of the followers - it happened in 2017. In an age where cults like Heaven's Gate, Branch Davidians, and the People's Temple have come and gone with worldwide coverage. Where any knowledge of cults and cult-like behavior are at your fingertips. 

How many religions in the ancient world began the same way? With the same type of charismatic leader, who with utmost sincerity, reached the right audience at the right point in history? And how much more susceptible were these citizens of ancient cultures to movements such as these, with no access to universal information, very little (if any) formal education, and a staggeringly low literacy rate. All underscored by the unique plight of life in the ancient world, with little access to effective medicine, brutal wars, totalitarian governance. These are the circumstances under which major world religions such as Christianity and Islam came forth.

It just seems poignant to me that a common understanding of major world religions is that their origin stories somehow exist outside of the realm of cult-like behavior, when in reality, the similarities are striking. 

What's that saying? The difference between a religion and a cult is time and the amount of followers? Curious to know your thoughts."
cults,iug5gm,how growing up in a cult affected my mindset. can anyone relate?,"how growing up in a cult affected my mindset -

1.a. black and white emotions about undertanding in relationships - all or nothing - you're either fully understood, or being partly understood equals completely misunderstood 》 which results in putting person in the ""outsider"" position to you which is also feeling betrayed and lonely AKA miserable.
1.b. people either should lack all boundries with me/have same emotional reactions as me or they're outsiders and i push them away/exclude them from me emotionally/mentally. no inbetween. (the consequences are that i don't interact with people or have friends because I'm not interested in connections that arent extreme. i'm very lonely but being with other people makes me feel lonelier)
1.c. basically the concept and term of the outsider (vs insider or ally) is something very present in my life and an obsticle

2. loneliness = misery. i was groomed and shaped into the mindset that happiness=lack of boundries to the point of becoming one with another person. i wasn't allowed or taught boundries and both physical and mental privacy didn't exist.

3. objectifying myself - i was taught I'm a tool to make others happy and a tool to teach others to ""see the light"". i view my mind, my body, my worth through the eyes of others. if I'm not smart in the eyes of others, if I'm not physically attractive in the eyes of others (including even my own dad), then i AM worthless.

some stuff i struggle with my entire life (which i didn't even realize is abnormal until this year) that i wanted to let out and vent. thank you if you took the time to read and hear my voice and have a great day and a beautiful weekend. if anyone who grew up in a cult as well can relate I'd love to hear."

cults,itmjfv,Escaping the Moonie Cult (Update),"2 Sundays ago I busted out of my home in the middle of my dad teaching about his Moonie beliefs. I was gone from home for a day and a half. A group of men including my friend who I planned this escape with came to my driveway of our home and I busted out with my book bag I prepared near the front door. I ran for my life and grew 6 pairs of extra balls and stepped into the car as we drove off. My anxiety took over and I was hyperventilating, I was squeezing my book bag and felt tired than ever before compared to when I ran 5 miles non stop in my life. Unfortunately I have made it back the next day in the afternoon. However it seems that I have mentally escaped and that I was able to confront my dad fully that I do not follow the Unification Church, I do not follow reverend Moon's teachings, and I am for sure not like him. It seems that he will take it easy from now on and more than half the family is now taking my side. However I am now officially psychologically impaired (obviously not specifying) and have to seek institution some time soon... I always thought forever good things will never happen to me, but now I can see that there is still hope. I am stupid and I'm also not a good son in general and I know for sure I'm not a good student as of now cause I'm currently failing with school stuff. I also have told me if he forces or tries to again in the future then he will see me run out the door like I did last time. In a few years or  less, I will be physically away from here, and I will go to a better place. A place where I can definitely gain new experiences I should of had when I was younger and also meet newer people, as well as being able to see my current friends anytime I want compared to those times I have been dealing with spiritual abuse within this household...

About ten minutes ago I opened up a fairly mundane YouTube video about some nice music and one of the ads was real weird. 
This ginger lady with an interesting maybe eastern European accent was sat in a field talking about a magic tree, how ""if you are seeing this ad you are special"", it struck me as odd. I couldn't catch all of it, I rarely pay attention to the ads.
The company name started with A and had a white line work logo on a plain black background.
I don't know what it was but it was strange to me."

The reason I'm finally submitting a post is a conversation with a friend of mine (55F) today. She's been taking educational programs to become a trauma therapist for the last couple of years, and I've always been very supportive of her second career.  
 
However, today she told me she believes that there is ongoing ritual abuse of children by ""Satanist cults"", who are organized in a worldwide secret network. 

I always took her for a rational person, so this really shook me. Can anyone here guide me to good sources to debunk this claim? 

Disclaimer: I don't doubt for a second that there are worldwide organizations who make loads of money with child trafficking. But those are despicable greedy perverted assholes, not Satanists. It's a business, not a cult with weird rituals and incense and skull props.

cults,islyl5,Veganism as a cult - examining the coercive techniques,"If you browse over to r/exvegan or r/AntiVegan then you will see many people who state that veganism is a cult. I sympathize with those thoughts, since I see veganism as critical and destructive, but perhaps calling it a ""cult"" isn't accurate. I have received many negative responses from non-vegans when I call veganism a ""cult"". I think many people respond negatively to that because A) they see veganism as a ""diet"" (it's not -- vegans will strongly deny that point), B) veganism has no single leader, and C) veganism is not a money-making operation. But none of this means that veganism doesn't employ the same coercive techniques that typify cult behavior.

Let's examine veganism through that lens [https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html)

I am not describing the disconnected vegan who knows no other vegans. I'm describing the highly-connected vegans who only associate with other vegans. I'm not talking about your ""nice vegan friend"" that has ""never been pushy with you"".

&gt;1) The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment.

Not true for veganism. Some vegans will quote vegan sources like they are scripture, and the dogma is strident. 
   
&gt; 2) The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.

Yes, big time. With other cults, the pretend goal is ""helping humanity"". With veganism, it's ""helping animals"".
   
&gt; 3) The group is preoccupied with making money. 

Not true for veganism. Though I wonder if there are some hucksters making money in it. 
   
&gt; 4) Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.

Absolutely true in veganism. Just check out some of the ""responses to ex-vegans"" on YouTube. They will use language like ""so and so was never vegan to begin with"", which is religious language.
   
&gt; 5)  Mind-numbing techniques (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in  tongues, denunciation sessions, debilitating work routines) are used to  suppress doubts about the group and its leaders. 

Not true for veganism. Though I wonder if ""vegan activism"" can apply. 
   
&gt; 6) The  leadership dictates -- sometimes in great detail -- how members should  think, act, and feel (e.g.: members must get permission from leaders to  date, change jobs, get married; leaders may prescribe what types of  clothes to wear, where to live, how to discipline children, and so  forth).  

There is no ""leadership"" in veganism, but there is quite a bit of intra-vegan enforcement (""Are you sure that's vegan?""). They forbid other members from wearing leather, feeding their children (or their cats!) non-vegan food, et cetera.
   
&gt; 7) The  group is elitist, claiming a special exalted status for itself, its  leader(s) and members (e.g.: the leader is considered the messiah or an  avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save  humanity). 

Oh hell yes. Vegans crow about being ""morally superior"", and call veganism the ""moral baseline"" (that everyone in the out-group is beneath).
   
&gt; 8) The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which causes conflict with the wider society.  

HUUUUUGE in veganism. They call non-vegans ""murderers, slavers, rapists, carnists"", et cetera.
   
&gt; 9) The  group's leader is not accountable to any authorities (as are, for  example, military commanders and ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis  of mainstream denominations). The group teaches or implies that its  supposedly exalted ends justify means that members would have considered  unethical before joining the group (e.g.: collecting money for bogus  charities). 

Not in veganism. 
   
&gt; 10) The  leadership induces feelings of guilt \[embarrassment, humiliation, and  shame, as well as self-doubt and anxiety\] in members in order to control  them. 

No leadership to speak of, but the shaming is certainly there. ""Are you sure that's vegan?"" 
   
&gt; 11)  Members subservience to the group causes them to cut ties with family,  friends, and personal group goals and activities that were of interest  before joining the group. 

Partially. Members have conflicts with family (who don't appreciate being told that they are sinners and often react with hostility) and there is some conversation about cutting ties in vegans. 
   
&gt; 12) Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group. 

Partially. Some vegans will express these kinds of pressures, others won't. 
   
&gt; 13) Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.

Partially. See number 11."
cults,iskv97,"Has anyone seen a publication like this before? Def giving me heaven's gate vibes. Found it in my husband's uncle's stuff, he died recently and only got to cleaning stuff out, now. It's some wierd stuff. Maybe someone here knows?",
cults,isj7xf,Moonies - Unification Church,"I was unlucky enough to be born in this cult. So, there are mainly 2 types of members, the first generation and the second generation. The first generation are the ones that joined the church and the second generation are the ones who are born in the church.

Basically what the members believe is that through the blessing (a process where you get married to someone random) they remove the original sin and the kids born in this church are born without original sin however if they don’t keep their chastity before getting blessed they become fallen like the rest of the world. Everyone with the original sin will burn in hell forever after they die, basically anyone outside the church will burn in hell forever.

How the church grew so large: this is because the first generation could not get the blessing unless they find 3 new members. Many first generation were so desperate to get the blessing that they did months hunting for member and found many members to make sure that at least 3 of those members will stay in the cult until they get blessed. Recently say 15 years ago this was removed and you can get the blessing immediately because it was becoming too hard to find 3 members to join and many would just give up. Having said that parents complain that the process for them to get to the blessing was very hard and we should appreciate their efforts and complain that the life of the second generation is much easier (they are the ones that joined the cult and complaining). Also the first generation were told to have many kids as possible of course to have more organic growth and at lease if one of your child becomes fallen you have another child that can continue the linage. The first generation are so desperate that their kids go to the blessing because if they don’t go their life would be wasted, one of the first generation had a mentally disabled child and forced the child through the whole process and in the end the child remained alone. Many first generation hate each other and still stay together, some don’t even speak to each other which is really creepy when you see them together. Even the family of Sun Myung Moon is falling apart, one of the sons committed suicide and another used to be a drug addict and beat his wife. After Sun Myung Moon died the cult split into 3 because the family fought against each other for the wealth of the cult. 

Second generation had to go to classes to learn the divine principle which used to be a waste of time for everyone. Second generation have a lot of pressure on them because if they become fallen, all the sacrifices (basically regrets) of the first generation will be lost. If all the children of the first generation become fallen, the first generation loses the will to live and if the second generation becomes fallen they will be shamed. In fact there are a lot of suicides happening in the church and when a suicide happen the church leader sends an email saying that this happened because the person committing suicide was not following the divine principle which is disgusting. After the suicide the other members make sure that the family members that experienced the suicide keeps going to the cult meetings and if they don’t, they ask why didn’t you come to the meeting, they go to meet the family for a ‘chat’. Suicides are also common amongst first generation.

Second generation are encouraged not to socialize with the outside world because the cult is afraid that the second generation becomes fallen and the first generation don’t allow relationships with members outside the cult. So the second generation have no idea on what a relationship is and go to the blessing to find a random person and have to live with their partner for the rest of their life. Now the blessing process of the second generation changed and the parents find the partner for their kids. There is a website were second generation upload their photos and the parents find the partner for their kids. Once they think there is a match parents of both second generation have a chat and allow the second generation to start talking with each other. If the marriage fails they are considered fallen which of course the majority fails. Many stay together hating (same as first generation) each other just not to become fallen. Most second generation don’t have kids together after years being together, some over 10 years. Some second generation get blessed and you never see them again, they get the blessing and “leave” the cult as in reality they don’t want to have anything to do with the cult.

I would say that 90% of the marriages are mixed race and couples are matched from countries that hate each other because they think that the grandparents won’t hate their grand kids. They couldn’t have been more wrong, some parents of the first generation still won’t want to have anything to do with their kids and grandkids. Also the second generation would be living in the enemy country and makes life difficult for them because of the half side coming from the enemy country. Also the grandkids won’t be able to communicate or make a proper conversation with the grandparents that live in the other country which defeats the whole purpose. The first generation (the one’s that have their partner speaking the same language) would  say that the children should have learn both languages which is impossible because both parents always broke and working and wasting their time in the cult so they have no time for their kids.

The cult became so rich because a lot of members gave up all they had to the cult so it could grow. Sun Myung Moon used to tell members that to spread the truth, all members should give everything to the cult. Some members gave their homes and land to the cult and some of them did years working and giving 100% of their salary. The first generation used to live in one building and everyone used to eat the same food and sleeping in bunk beds. The first generation were mainly money makers for the cult and the cult fed them and gave them shelter. Also the ones that didn’t make enough money would go door to door selling staff to people to make more money. The cult leader of the community at the end of the month would show who was giving the most and who was giving the least which was shameful for the ones in the bottom of the list. Now the cult ask huge amounts of donations, sometimes asking 1.5k dollars per family and members are now required to pay 10% of their salaries to the cult.

The cult also believe in the 3 generation process which they think that after 3 generations the life of the cult members will become easier because the grandparents, parents and kids can grow in the cult freely and all should be able to understand each other. The problem is that many first generation had kids when they were over 35 years old and now many second generations are doing the same or not having kids. Now if the second generation has a kid at 35, the first generation would be 70 years old and before the child reaches their teens most first generations are dead or crippled and the process start again.

Now a days the cult is falling apart. Most second generation leave the cult by becoming ‘fallen’ and don’t want to have anything to do with the cult and some leave because how dumb the first generation are. Once all the second generation of the family leaves the cult, the first generation also will want nothing to do with the cult because now there is no point in meeting with the other cult member. Overall the first generation hate each because of the history they had together. This first generation sacrificed more than the other first generation; some say that other first generation are dumb (the pot calling the kettle black).  

It is difficult to say how many members are in this cult. They do a count once in a while, but leaders are afraid to show the actual numbers because they will be shamed. Normally if the leader doesn’t know if the second generation is ‘fallen’ they are added to the list as members and some just add all the family members as members. 

They promote peace but in all my life in this cult I can’t remember that they did anything for peace, sure they did a few meetings but nothing ever came out of the meetings just waste of money and effort. The only things I can remember are; that the cult was always asking for money, I am not putting effort to meet up (who wants to meet up with close minded idiots), this and that are not good and loads of waste of time. 

In short stay away and if you are in it find away to get out."

cults,is2ebg,Blood Over Intent Leader Starting IRL Cult?,"[BOI Leader YouTube House Announcement](https://youtu.be/gHQvSaohhqE)

I posted a comment on an old thread about this but don't think anyone saw it, so this is an edited re-post of that.

I've been following ""Blood Over Intent"" for years and feel something significant just happened. If you don't know what that is, it's a subset of the Flat Earth community that got into a form of blood magic, that as of now seems to have almost entirely lost its steam (along with the larger FE community). They would write their ""divine intent"" to bring heaven on Earth on paper, then cut themselves and post a video of themselves spreading their blood over it.

As has been noted, it was apparently started by the truly psychotic Mark Braun or ""QuasiLuminous"" (now usually going by Saturn or Satan on YouTube, where he disappears and reappears frequently), but there have been other clear leaders among them. One is Devin Madgy, now ""Flat Earth Paradise"" on YT.

I could go on forever about this guy, but here's the gist: unlike QL, he comes off as intelligent and charismatic. For a long time he posted about BOI and random New-Agey nonsense, but he made very high-quality videos and before long had tens of thousands of subs. Notable things he's done: Had a big falling-out with QL and basically became the movement's biggest voice. Planned, raised money for, and ultimately abandoned the ""S.E.A.L."" Project in which he aimed to travel to the north pole to prove there's a giant hole there leading to the Garden of Eden. Largely abandoned BOI topics, becoming more focused on bizarre New Age crap. Traveled the country mooching off his supporters, including a weeks-long road trip he called ""The Ride of Remembrance"". Announced he is the reincarnation of Hermes/Thoth, ""messenger of the gods,"" and could ""manipulate matter at will"". Made predictions about vague yet supposedly cataclysmic events.

Anyway here's where I'm going with this... I used to comment on his videos, and once asked him when he's getting a Cult House and moving disciples in. He actually made a smart-ass reply.

I was joking, but the bastard's gone and done it, and my link is his announcement and invitation. It's a beautiful property with gardens. I feel an IRL cult is forming before my eyes. He's even gone Full Jesus with his appearance. I THINK he's from SE Michigan (like me!), but the property is in Oregon. Cult experts and enthusiasts: tell me what you think."

cults,irv3g2,http://www.thinkatheist.com/profiles/blogs/soka-gakkai-international-welcome-to-the-world-of-non-profit," Cult Warning Signs in SGI  
1. Authority without accountability. Soka  Gakkai claims to have absolute authority withregard to Nichiren  Buddhism; Nichiren Buddhism can only be correctly practiced if one is a  member of SGI. Daisaku Ikeda is promoted by SGI to be the foremost  authority on Nichiren Buddhism for the modern age. But SGI provides no  accountability — members have no control over their leaders and have no  mechanism by which to affect the policies and procedures of their  organization.  
2. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.  There are no opportunities to publicly question or critique the  teachings of SGI in organizational publications. Critiquing SGI at small  discussion meetings may be tolerated to a degree, but this behavior is  called “negativity” and is discouraged.  
3. No meaningful financial  disclosure and no independently audited financial statement. Media  reports and property tax records confirm that Soka Gakkai is a  multi-billion dollar religious corporation. SGI refuses to disclose its  finances even to members and donors who request this information. SGI  has publicly maligned members who have pressed for financial disclosure.  
4.  Unreasonable fear about evil conspiracies and persecutions. Ikeda and  his followers have denounced as “evil” a rival group called Nichiren  Shoshu, and urged SGI members to fight this so-called devilish  influence. SGI has sponsored prayer vigils focused on the destruction of  Nichiren Shoshu and the demise of its leader, Nikken. SGI has also  assigned at least one paid staff member to follow and spy on Nichiren  Shoshu priests. Why? SGI claims that Nichiren Shoshu is out to destroy  SGI.  
5. The belief that former members are always wrong in leaving  SGI. Former members often relate similar stories of being pressured to  embrace certain beliefs, to say only positive things about SGI and to  participate in fund raising, recruitment and public relations campaigns.  Former members have a similar grievances regarding SGI: too much  emphasis on the “evil” of Nichiren Shoshu, too much adulation of Daisaku  Ikeda and too little emphasis on the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism.  SGI leaders tell members that former members are deluded, cannot be  trusted and should be avoided.  
6. Dependence upon SGI guidance and  activities for problem solving, solutions, and definitions without  meaningful reflective thought. When SGI members are confronted with a  problem, they are urged to seek “guidance” from local SGI leaders or to  read guidance from Ikeda. Members are urged  
to recruit more members  and participate in more SGI activities in order to have a “breakthrough”  and solve their problems. If the problem is resolved, leaders are quick  to claim that participation in SGI activities provides mystical  benefits. If the problem is not resolved the member is often advised to  make a greater commitment to SGI and “connect” with Ikeda’s heart.  
7.  Anything that SGI does can be justified, no matter how questionable or  harmful. SGI members are good at making excuses for the shortcomings of  their organization. “We’re still in our infancy — we’ve only been in  America for a little over 30 years — mistakes are to be expected,” they  say. “We are only human. Of course we make mistakes.” “We are fulfilling  an important mission, so even if people are hurt by our activities, it  will all work out for the best in the end.” “If people are hurt by our  organization it is due to their karma, not ours.” “People are afraid of  SGI not because we are deceptive and manipulative, but because we  represent a real challenge to the status quo. People can’t handle the  truth and justice we represent.” The list of excuses for bad behavior  goes on and on.  
8. SGI members are afraid. SGI members have been  indoctrinated with a litany of fears: fear of visiting temples or  investigating other forms of Buddhism, fear of not chanting enough or  skipping gongyo, fear of contradicting the SGI, fear of listening to or  entertaining criticism of the SGI, fear of chanting to the “wrong”  Gohonzon, fear of leaving the SGI. SGI members fear that these things  will invite severe “mystical” punishment such as financial hardship,  illness, family strife, loss of a romantic relationship, getting fired  from a job or a horrible, agonizing death.  
So what if SGI is a cult?  
In  her book Seductive Poison, Deborah Layton shows how anyone can fall  under the spell of a cult. Layton was a high-level member of Jim Jones’  Peoples Temple. She tried to warn a skeptical public about impending  disaster at Jonestown, Guyana. At Jonestown on November 18, 1978,  hundreds of cult members perished in a mass murder/suicide. In the  epilogue to her book, Layton writes: “Looking back, there are a few  things I have come to learn. People do not knowingly join “cults” that  will ultimately destroy and kill them. People join self-help groups,  churches, political movements, college campus dinner socials, and the  like, in an effort to be a part of something larger than themselves. It  is mostly the innocent and naive who find themselves entrapped. In their  open-hearted endeavor to find meaning in their lives, they walk blindly  into the promise of ultimate answers and a higher purpose. It is  usually only gradually that a group turns into or reveals itself as a  cult, becomes malignant, but by then it is often too late. I hope my  book will give my daughter some answers about how I got caught and how  the Jonestown tragedy happened. I hope it will provide clues about the  workings of a cult and shed light on the darkness of deceit. There are  essential warning signs early on. Our alarm signals ought to go off as  soon as someone tells us their way is the only right way.  
When our  own thoughts are forbidden, when our questions are not allowed and our  doubts are punished, when contacts and friendships outside of the  organization are censored, we are being abused for an end that never  justifies its means. When our heart aches knowing we have made  friendships and secret attachments that will be forever forbidden if we  leave, we are in danger. When  
we consider staying in a group because  we cannot bear the loss, disappointment, and sorrow our leaving will  cause for ourselves and those we have come to love, we are in a cult.  
If  there is any lesson to be learned it is that an ideal can never be  brought about by fear, abuse, and the threat of retribution. When family  and friends are used as weapons in order to force us to stay in an  organization, something has gone terribly wrong. If I, as a young woman,  had had someone explain to me what cults are and how indoctrination  works, my story might not have been the same.  
It’s never “harmless” when people are deceived or manipulated under the guise of religion.  
1. A legitimate sangha or teacher will answer your questions without becoming judgmental and punitive.  
2.  A legitimate sangha or teacher will disclose information such as  finances and often offer an independently audited financial statement  regarding budget and expenses.  
3. A legitimate sangha or teacher shares decision-making and encourages accountability and oversight.  
4.  A legitimate sangha or teacher may have disgruntled former followers,  but will not vilify, excommunicate and forbid others from associating  with them.  
5. A legitimate sangha or teacher will not have a paper  trail of overwhelmingly negative news reports, magazine articles and  statements about them.  
6. A legitimate sangha or teacher will recognize reasonable boundaries and limitations when dealing with others.  
7. A legitimate sangha or teacher will encourage critical thinking, individual autonomy and feelings of self-esteem.  
8. A legitimate sangha or teacher will admit failings and mistakes and accept constructive criticism and advice.  
9.  A legitimate sangha or teacher will not be the only source of knowledge  and learning excluding everyone else, but will foster real dialogue,  debate and the free exchange of ideas.

I haven't gone through reconfirmation or rebaptism (I was already an every day, Novus Ordo, modern day, Roman Catholic)  or anything yet but I'm in the catechesis stage  (where they teach you how to be ""catholic"" and their sets of rules.).  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on washing my hands of them after looking up the history of their organization and all the creepy cult behavior they exhibit (won't answer questions, gets very angry when you ask questions, inordinately emphasizes submission to authority, pushes for not questioning authority, emotional manipulation, tries to put wedge between you and your family/support group).   


I still would like to stay on friendly terms with the family friends that go there though if possible. The priest I've been dealing with has been instructing me out of an altered (whole sections are redacted) of the Baltimore Catechism. He wouldn't let me leave it in the ""mass center"" (what they call their churches) probably so I would feel obligated to come back with it and study more. I was planning on taking it back and maybe attending one more service before never showing up again. I was also considering taking someone with me for support. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has had any experience with these individuals, this kind of situation, or has any other helpful advice, it is more than welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

cults,ir2m0w,A Documented Source," ""In  Japan, Soka Gakkai has been a controversial organization from the  time  of it's founding, though most Americans would support it's  attempts to  keep it's organizational integrity in the face of  government pressure  prior to World War 11.  During the 1970s, Soka  Gakkai broke into the  following some noteworthy successes of its  political arm, the Komeito,  or Clean Government Party.  Founded in  1964, the Komeito had, by the  mid-1970s, become the third largest  political party in Japan.  As the  Komeito grew, Ikeda moved into the  political arena and launched a  campaign for international world peace.   Throughout the 1970s Ikeda  traveled and met with such world leaders  and intellectuals as Arnold  Toynbee, Henry Kissinger, and John Kenneth  Galbraith.  The success of  the Komeito underscored the controversial  practice of the Soka Gakkai,  shakubuku, literally ""to break and subdue""  the evil spirits and make  straight the true teaching of Buddha.  It is  a principle of Nichiren  Shoshu that it is the true religion and true  form of Buddhism, and it is  the duty of every believer aggressively to  pressure friends, family,  and acquaintances into converting.  Shakubuku  includes strong polemic  against other faiths, the use of rational  argument, and the application  of psychological and even physical  pressure.  In Japan numerous  accusations of violence by Nichiren Shoshu  members arose during the  1970s, and opponents charged that much of  their growth came through  strong-arm tactics. In the United States  shakubuku has primarily  appeared as high-pressure evangelism, without  the physical coercion  noted in the Japanese situation.  Once the more  objectionable aspects of  the practice were discontinued in Japan,  reference to it in the United  States virtually disappeared, and signs  of tension between Nichiren  Shoshu and the larger culture have  diminished almost to a point of  nonexistence.  While a small  organization of former had been formed to  oppose NSA, in the demise of  controversy, that organization has been  ineffectual in attracting  attention or aligning its work to the larger  anti-cult movement."" *Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults* pages 268-269 J.  Gordon Melton Revised and Updated Edition 1992   (NSA was the original name for SGI-USA.  NSA stood for Nichiren Shoshu of America)."

At the start of the pandemic, my sister-in-law became obsessed with TikTok. She then found TikTokers that call themselves light workers and they do past life regressions and all that. She had a past life regression done and since then, she has gone crazy. She thinks she talks to dragons, she says she was an angel and her wings were clipped and she can see other people’s wings, she says she meets people in their dreams, she’s on a mission, and she’s waiting for the ascension (5d). She believes in conspiracy theories related to QAnon and the COVID vaccine. All of this crazy talk stems from TikTok and people on TikTok. She never believed this stuff before. All of this has caused her to leave my brother. She wants a divorce, but has no real reason for wanting it. We think it’s related to her new found spirituality. Has anyone heard of a TikTok cult?  Is this even possible?  Her actual family does not know the extent of her beliefs, because she only tells them little bits of it. I think she knows how crazy she sounds. I’m worried for my brother who is devastated over her leaving, but I’m also worried for my 6 year old niece who is stuck in the middle of all this."

I just want to move to a cult commune blocked off from the world so I don't have to worry about that, even if it meant dealing with the abuses of normal cults.

cults,iqopa5,My Introduction,"I was exposed to two cults in my lifetime, the Nation Of Islam and the Soka Gakkai International.  I never officially joined the Nation Of Islam, however I came close.  I had been going to the Monday night meetings and attempted to write a letter that was necessary for joining.  The letter was rejected over and over, so I said, ""This is a sign that this isn't for me.""  I still went to the NOI Sunday morning meetings which overtime just became nauseating with the same old stuff, no progress as it pertained to black people, homophobia, and reactionary ideas of 50s morality.  I sadly joined the SGI pseudo-Buddhist cult at age 25.  

I first heard of SGI in during the  2013 October Pride.  By this time I had been chanting on my own for some  months.  I picked up that booklet *The Winning Life*.   I read the book front and back, but it didn't motivate me to join.  I  reached out to Nichiren Buddhist communities on Facebook and that's how I  ended up  in contact with a SGI member.  I went to my first  introduction to Buddhism meeting with a MD in January 2014.  On the way,  I was put off by him saying that everyone was chanting to become happy.   After the opening chanting, I told the man I  had to study Biology.  I  did, but I also wanted to get out of there.  The MD gave me a *World Tribune* to read. I never read it.  It reminded me too much of the NOI's *Final Call*.

Summer  2014: I researched Soka Gakkai by way of Wikipedia, as I hadn't heard  of Reddit yet.  So far, what I had read was glowing, but I still wasn't  convinced to join.

Affixing breakthroughs to SGI activities

August  2015: I had a financial aid problem in college.  Chanting and doing  Gongyo wasn't working.  Then I had went to a study meeting, imbibed the  concepts and little by little the problem resolved.  I connected the  resolution of the problem to chanting, and doing activities.

September 2015 First seed of doubt:

This is from the September 2015 *Living Buddhism* pages 60-61.

""If   members persevere with strong faith to the very end, they will be   victorious, even if they should die from illness.  There are many who,   while suffering from illness, have chanted for kosen-rufu and the   happiness of others, and continued to reach out to encourage those   around them right up to the very moment of death.  Their lives and their   bravery in the face of death have given courage and inspiration to   countless others.  Such people will quickly be reborn with healthy   bodies.  I knew a young girl who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at age   11 and died at 14.  But throughout her illness, she was always happy   and bright.  She even cheered up the adults in the hospital with her   sunny, positive presence.  No doubt her illness caused her terrible   pain, but she continued to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and to encourage   others.  When she was near death, she said to one of her last visitors:   'I don't care about my illness anymore.  I've stopped chanting for   myself.  There are so many others worse off than me.  I'm chanting with   all my heart that they will take faith as soon as possible and find out   for themselves just how wonderful the Gohonzon is.'  To her parents,  she  said brightly: 'What if this had happened to you, Dad?  We'd be in   terrible trouble!  And it would be just as bad if it had happened to   you, Mom.  And if it had happened to my little brother, I'm sure he   wouldn't have been able to handle it.  I'm glad that it happened to me   instead of any of you... I'm sure this is the result of a promise I made   before I was born.  If my life can somehow touch and inspire those who   know me, I will be happy.'  Hearing this girl's struggle with illness,  I  sent her a bouquet of roses.  I also sent her a Japanese poem on  which I  had written the words ""Light of happiness"" and a photograph I  had taken  of a field of irises in bloom.  I heard that she was thrilled  when she  received them.  To those around her, she left the words  'Faith means to  continue to believe until the very end.'  And she  demonstrated those  words with her own life.  At her funeral, a long  line of people came to  pay their respects.  In her brief 14 years, she  had told over a thousand  people of the greatness of the Mystic Law. She  won.  That's what I  believe.  Everything that happened to her had  meaning.  Or rather,  through her struggle, she gave meaning to her  suffering.  She said that  her illness was the result of a promise she  had made in her past  lifetime."" ""...If those who embrace the Mystic Law  were blessed with  every form of happiness from the start, no one would  ever come to know  how powerful and effective Nichiren Buddhism is.   That's why we  voluntarily choose to be born with problems and suffering  so that we can  show others what human revolution looks like.  It is as  if we are  performing a part in a play, a great drama.""  That did not inspire me one iota.

November 2015: I began to imbibe the  concept of esho funi (oneness of self and environment) into my life.  I began to use that concept to  change my relationships with people.  By that I meant that I had  determined to change myself so my life would improve, family would  improve, and finances would improve.  My evenings between November 2015  and January 2016 were spent kind of like this

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8mdbHrWi38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8mdbHrWi38) starting at 0:34 time stamp.

\*There  is nothing wrong with taking responsibility for any way you are  contributing to your own distress.  The problem arises when you try to  take responsibility for things beyond your control.  You cannot control  the weather.  You cannot control your reality.  You cannot control how  people feel about you; no matter how long you chant for their happiness.   There are people who will dislike you no matter how nice and  respectful you are, or make an effort to be.  When that happens, the  problem has *nothing* to do with you.  I am telling you this now to spare you a catastrophic meltdown.\*

Also  I began to shakubuku people on my campus,  and in my hometown  community.  I had really imbibed the message of shakubuku being the  fastest way to change karma.

\* For those who may wonder how could an erudite person get sucked into such a cult,  assess these factors

* Generational indigence
* Substance abuse within family
* Domestic abuse within family
* Tempestuous familial relationships
* Had a difficult time making long-lasting friendships until my early mid-20s
* Bullying
* Social isolation
* Emotional isolation for the first 23 years
* Homophobia (internalized and external)
* Heteronormative inculcation
* Parental abuse
* Parental emotional neglect
* Difficulty fitting in except for at college

Sadly, no amount of book smarts can offset the deleterious effects of these factors.\*

2016: Now I initially wasn't totally  gung ho even as a member.  Yes I did shakubuku, but I told people about  nam myoho renge kyo and Nichiren more than about SGI and Daisaku Ikeda.   In 2016, my activity participation frequency increased slightly more.   As it related to Gajokai, I treated it like every now and then community  service.

September 2016: The  study format for Gosho study had changed.  There was no longer a Gosho  passage and Ikeda's lecture on certain passages.  It was now, 95%  Ikeda's lectures, and 5% Gosho snippets.  And I am being *very*  graceful with that percentage. Anyway, it paled in comparison to the  way it was when I first joined; it paled in comparison to the 2007-2010  editions of *Living Buddhism;* it paled in comparison to the 2005 editions of *Living Buddhism*.  I know this because as a lover of vintage things, I would read and collect old *Living* *Buddhism* editions from the past.  I worked around such a disappointing turn of events by reading the Gosho on my own time.

Fall  2016: This is when I first heard of the 50K initiative.  Personally I  wasn't on board with it.  I still remember being gung ho for Nation Of  Islam's 2005 Millions More Movement initiative and being so disappointed  when it ended only four years later.

Early  2017: I accepted a YMD district leadership position.  I only did it  really to fill in a quota because I was tired of the leadership gaps  within my district.  By gap, I mean that there was a WD leader, MD  leader, and a YWD who was MIA.  (In hindsight, good for her).

 August-October 2017:  By this time, I had used chanting to release a lot  of anger.  Now, I was gung ho for SGI.     Then I started to really see  fanatical behavior, and the regimentation.  I  was doing shakubuku with  a WD member from the NSA days.  She was trying  to push me to make  friends with one person I had shared nam myoho renge  kyo with. When I  told it took time for me to make friends with people,  she said, ""You  need to make friends more quickly.""    For months  to come, she would  ask me if I got in contact with that young man which  was a no.  Also,  that summer I had increased my Gongyo recitation to 3-5 times a day  since I couldn't chant up to four hours a day.  I was so happy to tell  her that.  I considered it splendid given that there were YD, even in  leadership positions, who still struggled with doing Gongyo twice a day.   To my dismay, she was not happy with that.  Even when I explained my  reasons.  The topic ended with her saying, ""Then you are not practicing  with the SGI.""  This was also in the same dialogue where she told me  about a woman who left the SGI and her house burned down.  Almost two  years later as I was defecting, I gave her a piece of my mind about  that.  Later on that month, I had a financial aid crisis.  Also, I had  neighbors with whom I didn't have a particularly good relationship with.   Along  with the practical scholarship search method, and the respect  the boundaries method, I also, handled it the SGI  way: chant like your  hair is on fire for 60+ minutes, shakubuku like  it's the NSA days,  participate in Soka Gakkai activities, and receive  some encouragement,  which boiled down to: think positive and don't  doubt.  I shakubuku'ed  x&gt;200 students.  Long story short, it didn't  keep me from losing my  enrollment and dorm housing; nor did it improve the relationship with  those neighbors.     I had to live under  a clandestine arrangement, however I was just   determined to have  legitimate housing.  So many nights, I was in study  rooms chanting and  furiously rubbing my beads together like a stark  raving madman; and I  participated in Soka Gakkai activities with the  hopes of accruing enough  good fortune to turn my condition around.  I  did it in spite of  inconvenience, and preference.  I participated in a  Soka Spirit toso  with the same WD and her MD husband knowing all I had  to eat for  breakfast was a cookie, which was insufficient.  Some weeks  later, I went to another district's district  discussion meeting with  her husband, and at his behest, I read the  lyrics to the god-awful song  ""I Seek Sensei"". 

 November 2017: I also lost a friend, who was a SGI member.  He had HIV  and died from AIDS complications.  I was devastated and baffled.   I  wondered, ""Sensei was told he wouldn't live past 30 due to   tuberculosis; and he's been defying the odds for six decades.  This was   supposedly due to his practice and efforts for kosen rufu.  My friend   had been dealing with HIV for over a decade and died three years after   becoming a member of the SGI.  Why?""   Later on that month, this Many    Treasures member asked me to do an experience.  I told her I  didn't  have   an experience.  Instead of finding someone else, she  encouraged  me to   use an ongoing struggle as an experience of  determination.  She  said   that it would encourage others.  So I did it.     It was a T.B.  C. experience.  A T.B.C. experience is a To   Be  Continued experience  where there is no victory given at the end,    rather it's a  re-determination to win.    I don't know who the hell   got encouraged  by my TBC experience but I  sure as hell didn't.  I hate   cliffhangers.   It's one of the reasons I  hate to watch the last  episodes  of *Moesha* and *Supah Ninjas.*   Also, normally when I gave experiences, I considered if I would be  convinced if it was coming from someone else.  With that being said,  I  am not encouraged because someone is continuing to  fight.   It sticks  in my craw that I gave this galling experience.   I  refuse to put my  hat in a losing battle.  That's just a waste of my   time and energy.   When I gave that TBC experience, it just created more   anxiety for me  because then I had to find a way to win, but since I was   told to put  more goals into the experience, I had to find a way to   accomplish  those too.  It was unnecessary stress. 

 December 2017:  I wasn't seeing eye to eye with my mother at the time  and trying to  find a place in the area, especially in order to make it  to the last  meeting of the year.    I had been told that making it to  the meeting would allow me to accrue good fortune.  However my apartment  was a day late.   The only place I could have went in the city was the  homeless shelter.   The MD  who was to drive me to my new apartment  dropped me off at the  homeless shelter.  Even if bunking with him would  have been a tall  order, he could have either had me lodge with someone  else, or just  dropped me off at the shuttle and said, ""I'm sorry you  can't make it.   Just get on the bus and go back home.  See you in  2018.""  Not drop me  off at a homeless shelter.  (Update: my mother and I  are doing better.  She was rightfully mad as hell when she found out  about me being in a  shelter).  The homeless shelter was terrible, *especially*  given that the hosts had terrible bedside manners.  The day afterwards I  had decided that if my room wasn't ready still, I was going to go back  home.  It turned out, my room was ready and I  was able to go to the  December 16 meeting.  Afterwards, I learned that  my room had bedbugs. I  had bites on my neck and arms.  I had to go to  the emergency room and  wait all  night for a prescription.  To the  couple's credit, they did  take me to Walmart and foot the bill for my  prescriptions.  But now, I  still have a $749 medical bill to pay from  that night.   Make no  mistake, I also studied the Gosho and President Ikeda's  writings.  But  frankly, President Ikeda's words just rang hollow as he  said a life  without problems would be empty and uneventful, and that  enduring and  overcoming difficulties are true ""peace and comfort"" .

 Early 2018:  I am convinced that the only way *anyone*  can still exhibit that SGI ardor after experiencing what I experienced  in 2017, they would have to either be under the influence, delusional,  or flat out attempting to distract themselves like Brad Nixon in *Bladfold*.   I was in essence going through the motions.   In  the months leading  up to the 50K Lions of Justice Festival, I had to   call YMD in my  district to try to motivate them to register.  Most of   the YMD in my  district had been MIA (Missing In Action) since before I   became a  member.  (Basically 12+ months MIA).  My personal rule is  this:  if  someone has not made an effort to surface or reach out, then  they  are  no interested in being a part of the SGI.  Anyone who was no  longer   interested in being a part of the SGI, I was willing to respect  their   decisions.  (Even as a member I had the mindset ""this is not a one  size   fits all"".) I felt so intrusive and disrespectful calling these  men  upon  orders from higher up.  I felt so terrible that when my higher  up  leader  suggested that we call throughout the week, I rebelled.  I   didn't call  at all.  Around this time, I was discouraged from goalless  chanting by a MD.  This quote by the late Marie Fredrikkson of Roxette  sums it up: ""  I was sad a lot of the time ... when I  always had to be  nice and say  the right things, always having to be  available to  everybody, always  putting on a smile and being happy...  I had less and  less space to be  myself. And when I was myself I felt uncertain, small  and lost.""  Besides, during this period, I was trying to revive my faith. 

 Summer 2018:  After graduation, I lived with my mom, maternal uncle, and  maternal grandparents.   The events of 2017 wrecked my self-confidence  and ravaged my faith in a way synonymous as an EF5 going through a  trailer park.  On top of that, living in my maternal grandparents' house  was a nightmare.  There was no central air so the heat was unbearable;  my uncle was, and likely still is, so disgruntled and would at random  moments take it out on my mom, maternal grandmother, and eventually me;  my maternal grandmother has dementia and would periodically throw her  weight around; I had no money; all of my friends lived hours away.   I  was so desperate to revive my faith that I bought *all* of the volumes of *The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra*  and a book of Ikeda's poetry, which is terrible.    In the end, all of  the studying failed to revive my faith.  No amount of study could  convince me that all of the hoops and drama that I had went through in  2017 was worth it.  Also, reading *The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra Volume 6* is how I learned of the late Junko Kobayashi (1949-06/26/1982). 

\*Junko Kobayashi:

She  had joined the Soka Gakkai in 1966 three months after her parents.   Three years after they joined, her mother died from cancer (so around  1969-1970).  Her father died shortly thereafter.  I only kept my  malcontent to myself.  Daisaku Ikeda gave her this encouragement after  the death of her father, ""For someone your age, the death of a parent is  something that you would expect to experience twice in the future.  So  really all that has happened is that you have experienced this somewhat  earlier than others.  But because you have the Gohonzon, everything will  be all right!""  Kobayashi exerted herself to the utmost in practice and  Soka Gakkai activities.  She was apparently able to even study abroad  in Spain.Two years later, a malignant tumor was discovered in her left  knee.  She underwent surgery, relearned to walk, and worked tirelessly  for kosen rufu in Spain.  In 1982, the cancer had metastisized in her  lungs and she died at the age of 32.  Remember when I said that she *exerted* herself.  Fuck a million, she did *20,000,000*  Daimoku from the time she first went to Spain, even in the terminal  stage of her cancer.  Here is some math for you in SGI terms:

10,000 Daimoku at galloping horse rhythm = 3 hours

20,000,000 Daimoku at galloping horse rhythm = 6,000 hours (250 days)

Now  while I understand that illness and death are inevitable, I expected  with this practice, for my life span would be extended to at least my  80s.\*

 By August, thanks to my mother's urging, I sought out employment, or  underemployment.  Then I started to practice consistently.  Up until  then, I would go days without doing Gongyo.  This time, when I started  practicing consistently, I resumed goalless chanting.  I also told my  mom that after 50K I was done with SGI due to the Ikeda focus.  I also,  as a result of Google surfing, stumbled upon this subreddit.  Here I  learned of the late Shin Yatomi who had died from lung cancer in 2007. 

 August 2018: Around this time, 50K rehearsals were to begin.  That  involved a huge carpool, thanks to the members.  I was in chorus.  The  first thing that put me off was the frenetic chanting during morning and  evening (well afternoon) Gongyo.  The first time dealing with that was  so terrible that I went a week without doing Gongyo because every time I  attempted, I would hear that frenetic chanting in my ear.  One weekend I  missed rehearsals because the first day I had ride issues.  The second  day, I didn't want to risk that again.  So instead, I went to my  zadankai.   MD who was taking me back home from zadankai told me that I  should have  stayed in the city and fought for the success of 50K, even  if it meant  being homeless because that's how one builds good fortune.   When I tried to explain what happened in 2017, he blamed me for my  struggle.  He told me that it was because I tried to make a deal with  the Gohonzon.  The only reason I didn't say anything was because I  didn't want to get kicked out mid-trip.  I wasn't going to risk  homelessness again.   The MD also encouraged me to pass out 50K flyers,  which I did out of desperation for a change in my estate.  I  accidentally sent it to someone who initially turned down my shakubuku  and that ended that contact. 

 September 2018:   Leading up to 50K, I assisted with vocal warm ups.   Since the music  involved using augmented second leaps for one verse and  a whole minor  seventh leap, I incorporated them into the warm ups.   (Thank you Hanon  No. 12). I really enjoyed that.  What I didn't enjoy  was studying excerpts from *The New Human Revolution*  or the regimentation where every YD, unless sick, was to participate in  Gongyo.  I worked around it by studying Gosho more so than Ikeda's  literature.  I practically treated Gosho like reading letters sent to  me.  It was almost like Celie from *The Color Purple*  reading letters from her sister Nettie.  Also, a WD assured me that I  could chant at my own pace.  So while everyone else was chanting like we  were riding out a 7.3 earthquake, I was chanting in a more slowly and  relaxed.   On the weekend before the festival, Southeast Region and  South Central  Region practiced together in a high school knowing that  on this day in  question (Saturday), the school's air conditioning was  malfunctioning.   Now the temperature outside was 90+ degrees  Fahrenheit.  It would have  been plausible to cut rehearsals short or  relocate, but no.  Three of us  got sick, including myself.  I had a  headache and nausea.  I felt  better the next day; and I got to miss  that closing Gongyo.  I heard  someone say that the Saturday closing  Gongyo was the best group Gongyo  session ever.  I am glad I missed it.  And after 50K, nothing really changed in my life.  Absolutely nothing.   My faith wasn't revived after 2017.  If ever asked if I would ever  participate in another event like 50K again, my answer would be no.  Absolutely not.   The one thing that turned me off at the festival were  the experiences  where Daisaku Ikeda was mentioned.  I did not join the  SGI to take part  in his approbation.   The ultimate takeaway from the  whole experience was this"" in the spirit  of itai doshin (many in body  one in mind), we will ameliorate our world  via doing our human  revolution in the name of esho funi (when you  change, the environment  changes). Everything was ultimately about Ikeda. 

 March 3, 2019 (My last KRG):  Leading up to March 3, meteorologists had  been discussing the chance for  severe storms for March 3, 2019 with a  chance for severe thunderstorms,  damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes.   The area I was living in at the  time since May 2018 was initially under  a Slight Risk for severe  weather. On March 3, the area was moved up to  Enhanced Risk.  I had a  concern about my grandparents' house, that I  was living in, being rocked  by a significant tornado, (EF2 or higher),  especially since it was old,  falling apart,and the foundation had been  corroded by chalk from a  nearby plant for over 45 years.  All I could  think, ""I have to get out  of here.  This house can't take an EF2.""  (An EF2 is a strong tornado capable of snapping or uprooting even large trees, tossing cars, and on the high end can toss 18-wheelers, demolishing mobile homes, tearing roofs and exterior walls off houses, turning light objects into impaling missiles, and apparently as seen in Rutherford County, Tennessee, can flip an unanchored house onto its roof).   So I was *not*  willing to find  out what that would possibly do to my house.  Given that  March 3, 2019  fell on a Sunday, there were no other businesses open in  the county,  and barely any business was open in the nearby counties.  So  I offered  to do a Gajokai shift at the kaikan nearly two hours away.  I  didn't  have a set way back home.  The only thing I could think about  was  getting out of a potentially life-threatening situation.  I own that   what I did was imprudent; I risked being stranded; and I inconvenienced   members who were kind enough to give me a ride back.  I of course was   upbraided for it.  I was sure to apologize and reimburse them as much as   I could.    Now I know that the SGI  would have been to trust the Gohonzon and ride  out whatever storm came.   After 2017, my attitude to that was hell no.  After 2017, that was *never*  happening again.   When you chant to live in the best place possible,  and the Gohonzon  has you supposedly going from a homeless shelter to a  bedbug-infested,  overly priced hovel, are you going to trust it to  protect you, or trust  it to have you ejected to your possible death?   Now thankfully my  house, and the neighborhood was unscathed in the midst  of two EF1s that  struck within 40 miles.  In total, on that day, over  40 tornadoes  touched down within that state, and the neighboring states.   It was  indeed a tornado outbreak.  The outbreak spawned an EF4, the  first  violent tornado the USA ever had in nearly two years, and that EF4   resulted in a death toll the USA has not seen since the 2013 Moore,   Oklahoma EF5. 

 Also, at that KRG, I talked to a Many Treasures member who spent two  years homeless and yet telling people that through chanting they could  get anything they wanted.  That sounds mortifying. 2 years; 24 months;  104 weeks; 730 days; 17,520 hours; 1,051,200 minutes; 63,072,000 seconds  of not knowing where you are going to sleep night after night; of  watching your fellow members, the people you shakubuku, including the  people you encouraged to trust the Gohonzon, leave your presence and to  houses while you hope you can get a spot at the shelter and *not*  have to sleep on asphalt; and yet telling people that they can get  anything they want via chanting.  Even if the spring eventually came,  was it really worth that level of humiliation?  In my case in 2017, it  wasn't. 

June 2019: By this time, I had just  given up on changing my family karma.  Also, I began to redefine myself  with a better perspective.  While I still identified myself as a  practicing Buddhist, SGI took a backseat me being a Buddhist and a  musician.  Also I was ready to leave SGI, but I didn't want to say, ""The  Gohonzon failed me"" because members could use that to say that I had  weak faith. If you don't believe me, assess these quotes:

""  Shin’ichi went on to say that the  secret to happiness was winning over   oneself and practising to the  Gohonzon with doubt-free faith that  flows  like a pure stream, no matter  what happens.

'The  Daishonin’s   Buddhism is made valid,” he said, “by documentary,  theoretical and   actual proof. But some people begin to have doubts as  soon as their   business suffers a little downturn, or say the Gohonzon  has failed to   protect them if, for instance, their child gets injured.  And there are   those who, when certain sectors of the mass media  criticize the Soka   Gakkai, begin to doubt the guidance of their  seniors in the Gakkai, lose   faith in the Gohonzon, and stop doing  gongyo altogether.

'These   are  people who tend not to reflect on themselves or their faith.   Instead,  whenever the slightest problem or setback occurs, they start   doubting  the Gohonzon or the Soka Gakkai. However, this only erases the   great  benefit they would have otherwise accumulated. 

'Babies   thrive because they drink  their mother’s milk without question. If  they  stop drinking it too  soon, however, their growth will be stunted  and  they’ll become weak  and susceptible to illness. In the same way, if  we  continue to have  faith in the Gohonzon and chant daimoku throughout  our  lives, we will  absolutely tap into the life force of the Buddha  and the  way we live  will reflect a condition of absolute happiness.

'Please   do not doubt the Gohonzon, but continue to chant daimoku and  work   together with the Soka Gakkai, the organization dedicated to    kosen-rufu. This is the way to enjoy a truly meaningful and happy life.”    Shin’ichi’s guidance expressed his earnest wish that each of his   fellow  members would enjoy a life of great fulfilment, abundant benefit   and  good fortune. '""

— ‘Pure Stream’, *New Human Revolution Volume 8*, 192–93

""Although I and my disciples may  encounter various difficulties, if we do no harbor doubts in our hearts,  we will as a matter of course attain Buddahood.  Do not have doubts  simply because heaven does not lend you protection. Do not be  discouraged because you do not enjoy an easy and secure existence in  this life.  This is what I have taught my disciples morning and evening,  and yet they begin to harbor doubts and abandon their faith.  Foolish  men are likely to forget the promises they have made when the crucial  moment comes."" WND-1, 283

Also, I  was talking with a MD from a SGI Facebook group and he brought up Nikko  Shonin's 26 Admonitions.  I realized that I disagreed with No. 21.

[http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/](http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/)

No.  21:   You should not sit together with slanderers of the Law  at  religious ceremonies for fear of suffering the same punishment as  they.

July 2019: Someone asked this question in the SGI Facebook group:  **I   am new to this practice. I am  also interested in Zen Buddhism. I  would  like to practice  both. Do  you think either would object ? Does  anyone  also practice both ?** I was okay with it.  Others  weren't.  I was so hard pressed not to say, ""Fuck what Nichiren says?""   And in the midst of an argument, I realized that I had my reason to  leave.

Now having read the  articles on the subreddit, I knew I had to be strategic with it; lest I  get pulled back in.  So I told my non-SGI friends about my defection.  I  didn't tell anyone in SGI for two weeks, howbeit given my exit  experience, I would suggest waiting 2-3 months before notifying.

The  first two weeks were actually great knowing that I was done with SGI.   When I finally got around to letting SGI members know that I was done, I  1. highlighted that I was leaving due to doctrinal disagreements 2.   Framed the defecting as I was leaving the Fuji tradition of Nichiren  Buddhism. (By Fuji tradition, that included the following schools:

* Nichiren Shoshu
* Shoshinkai
* Kenshokai
* Hokkeko)

My rationale for that was so no one  could say that I left SGI for Nichiren Shoshu, especially with 2020  being the 30th anniversary of Daisaku Ikeda beginning his lecture series  at Soka University, and 2021 will be the 30th anniversary of Ikeda and  Akiya being excommunicated from Nichiren Shoshu.(Soka Gakkai and SGI  were not really excommunicated in 1991.  Here is some proof.  Volumes of  *The Major Writings of Nichiren Daishonin,*  the Gosho edition that Nichiren Shoshu use to this day, were still  printed by NSIC (Nichiren Shoshu International Centre) and distributed  among Soka Gakkai and SGI until 1995.  Now why would Nichiren Shoshu  distribute its edition of the Gosho to a group that it already  excommunicated?  Given how quiet it is compared to SGI and Soka Gakkai,  it's not likely to be motivated as much by greed.)

Rationally speaking, if you don't believe  in the crux of a religion, there is no point in you staying whatsoever.

Or so I thought

The   closest friend I had made in the SGI, and had known for four years,   couldn't accept it.  When he found out through the SGI grapevine that I   was defecting, he called me.  Even after I read to him the article  which  *really* upset me.  It  upset me  because he was a fortune baby with a bachelor's in Sociology,  and the  admonitions are easily accessed under the Soka Spirit website.

[http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/](http://sokaspirit.org/home/newsletter/nikko-shonins-admonitions-and-nikken/)

If he didn't know, he could have used Google to find out.

Nevertheless   he set up a call meeting with a WD.  This was the same one who told me   to give that TBC experience.  This WD just lied to me like a corpse in  a  ravine.  Just lied to tell me what I would want to hear so I would   stay.  This is why SGI cannot be a force for change in the world.  It's  so attached to membership numbers that it will practically undermine  Nikko's doctrine, which Soka spirit is supposedly based on, in order to  keep members from leaving.  At the end of the call, that young man said,  ""Sensei says no  one who has left the SGI has ever found happiness.""   There really wasn't  much happiness when I was in SGI that's for sure."
cults,iqlrzr,The Cadi-fake Family,"Thread to discuss the “Davis family”, previously known as “House of Cadifor”. 

If you don’t know them... 

The Davis family is compromised of 6 females ranging 19-29 all with varying psychological pathologies and vulnerabilities such as narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder, and lead by their self proclaimed supreme master “Big Dick Jimmy” (spoiler: it’s not that big and kinda weird-looking like a sea cucumber). 

Their organization is thinly veiled mission to scam the government by collecting government payouts through continual “studying” of university degrees without any actual contribution back to society. Unless you count sex work. 

Despite being absolutely mediocre in every aspect, they will be quick to mention the sheer number of languages they speak, musical instruments they play, educational aspirations (seriously like 3 of them want to become doctors despite their prostitution history) and outdoor/survival abilities to anyone they meet!

If you want to have a laugh, can be found on instagram - “the_davis_family_adventures” with their various individual handles easily findable from there.


Feel free to discuss any aspects of their pitiful lives on this thread!"
cults,iqgam1,The at-least Semi-Cultic world of Professional Modeling,"I *can't* speak to how that world is today, but I sure as hell *can* from the 1970s to the 1990s. I did some myself. And I had occasion to hire a lot of models for photos and video shoots related to media advertising, printed materials (including fashion catalogues and glitzy real estate brochures), infomercials and other videos. 

Most of what *I* ran into would not fit into the criteria of the BITE Model or any of the others in [this article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html). But as one got closer to the Very Big *Fashion* Leagues -- as well as the porn industry -- one began to see a *lot* of high-demand, high-control, highly manipulative, saddle-up-the-pony-and-ride-it-with-the-whip-until-it-collapses dynamics one sees around such as the Church of Scientology and the entire est / Forum / Landmark cascade. 

I saw quite a few photo and video shoots that lasted from arrival for makeup at 6:00 a.m. to bar closing time. In those days, strong coffee, Coca Cola, Mountain Dew and nose-job cocaine were pretty commonly used to keep the models and the crews on a roll (more or less as in the 1997 feature film ""[Boogie Nights](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=boogie+nights+movie)""). Since then, motivational enhancements have also included anti-depressants, Rock Star, Monster, Red Bull, Ecstasy (Molly), crystal meth and crack TIKO. 

Agents and management at such as Elite, Ford, IMG and DNA have often been accused of running their (mostly adolescent) models like jockeys in the Derby, though the mostly well-heeled parents -- and their attorneys -- are wise enough now to prevent the sort of abuse that was more common years ago. In the *fashion* universe, at least.

But not so much in bare skin world... until recently. (The Internet and the age of laptops with video cameras has changed *everything*. The models are far more ofetn in charge of their own destiny in 2020.)

Back in the 1970s and '80s, however, a single agency called World Modeling on Van Nuys Boulevard in El Lay's San Fernando Valley controlled access to the lion's share of ""pretty girl,"" soft- and hard-core porn models in what was -- until fairly recently, and for the reason noted above -- a *very* substantial industry in SoCal. The very recently departed [Jim South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_South) was the soft-spoken, ostensibly easy-going, trust-inspiring face at WMA. But behind the scenes, the faces were a whole other thing. Bikers for sure, possibly Angels? IDK. But I do know that bikers and white slavers running white sex workers cozied up real nice everywhere from Bakersfield to Waycross in those days. 

I also found myself moonlighting in the paste-up room at Larry &amp; Althea Flynt's *Hustler* magazine while a g/f was doing her thing on camera there and elsewhere. Larry was pretty loosey-goosey, but Althea ran a very tight ship (like any madame who winds up well off). Having interviewed several former SeaOrg'ers who did time at the [CoS](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=church+of+scientology)'s Gold Base out in Hemet, however, I was struck by the similarities: For a workplace full of *sex*, everything was oddly rigid and antiseptic. Even, well, *tight-assed*. 

In retrospect, was I seeing the middle levels of a [Cultic Pyramid](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) in action there and (through my girlfriend's eyes) at the Hefner mansion? I'm not sure. But I can say that I spent enough time around a good half dozen of the ""regulars"" on the Playboy Channel's ""Electric Blue"" to get a sense of them as modeling *clay* in the hands of their various employers. 

While relatively accurate in many respects, ""Boogie Nights"" did *not* -- IMO -- show the sort of ""dead-eyed zombie"" look I saw on the faces of some (not all) of those girls. One thing was for sure, however: Every one of them had been [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology&amp;oq=social+construction+of+reality&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.7012j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)ed, [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), [imprinted]( https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_3784), habituated and [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) to a) a sort of us-vs.-them ""we're special"" exclusivity typical of cults and b) an attitude about sex and romance that was far closer to what middle- and upper-class millennials display now than what was typical at that time. 

And those attitudes did as much to separate then from their families and make them dependent upon each other, their agents and their hourly wage employers as has been the case at the GB and the Landmark office. 

Those girls would be 58 to 64 now, btw. I knew several into their 30s. They all looked pretty ""high mileage"" by then, and every single one had drug abuse problems and relationship difficulties. I also got to know a former, *highly* successful,  fashion-model-turned-TV-spokesperson who wound up the very same way. 

Moreover, many of them -- my girlfriend at [LFP](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=larry+flynt+publications) included -- became so addicted to cocaine that they fried themselves and either lost or gained so much weight they were no longer ""shootable,"" And were summarily wadded up and tossed in the proverbial dumpster... rather like what happened to *so* many at the Gold Base years later, and around the Landmark Forum headquarters in San Francisco at about the same time.

cults,iqcsa6,Angel Billings - RIP,"This is an unofficial obituary, because I can't find one anywhere, and he deserves one.

Angel Billings 1991 - 2020

Angel (Aaron) Billings was a gentle and talented musician, whose song was silenced on  August 21, 2020 at the age of 29 in West Valley, UT.    She was a beautiful and creative soul, though her life was plagued by physical and mental illness and childhood trauma caused by her upbringing within an abusive Mormon Fundamentalist Cult.  At the age of 22 she managed to escape that oppressive situation in 2013.  Though completely destitute and without adequate preparation to brave the world alone,  she persevered, and managed to work out her own medical relief and gainful employment, though only by living out of her car.  It's unclear whether the car fire was accidental, or by the pressure of her mounting trauma she took her own life.  What is clear is that she would never have been in that situation, had she been raised by compassionate parents in an emotionally stable situation.

Aaron chose the name 'Angel' when she came-out as trans-gendered recently, this is yet another thing her second-rate dick-tator father would never have tolerated, so it was 'closeted' for years.   

Angel is survived by an asshole cult-leader father and a mother who was his plural wife unwilling to challenge the authority of her husband to help her son, even in the most desperate circumstances.  She is also survived by over 50 full and half-siblings equally brainwashed by their narcissist father.  May they one day be free.

We will miss you Angel, and cherish our collective memories of your unique beauty and your music forever...  

Rest in peace..."

Are there any ex-vegans in this group who can confirm the behaviors expressed by vegans in the Wiki (above)? Did you experience shaming and attacks from vegan operatives when you walked away from veganism? Did they tell you that you were ""never a vegan to begin with""? (When I walked away from Christianity, I had Christians tell me that I was ""never a Christian to begin with"".) Did they tell you that you got into veganism ""for the wrong reasons"" or that you ""weren't doing veganism right""? (I have had Christians tell me that I got into Christianity ""for the wrong reasons"" and that I wasn't practicing ""true Christianity"".)

I believe that some people are going to be inspired to try to tell me that it's ""rude"" to call someone's diet a cult. Veganism is **not** a diet, as many vegans will emphatically tell you."

I got loads of responses which was great, but I need more male former cult members, as my research is looking at the difference in experience for men and women. If you can take the time to let me interview you online next week for my dissertation project that would be much appreciated. Please email me at k.khan7@edu.salford.ac.uk

Thanks,

cults,iq2bxf,What happens when a skeptical science writer meets a cult leader: Andrew Cohen,"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/what-happens-when-a-skeptical-science-writer-meets-a-cult-leader/

""Cohen recalled meeting only two fully enlightened people, both Indians. None of Cohen’s students have become liberated. To be sure, he said, many have had brief awakenings; some had insights so strong that they wanted to become teachers in their own right. But Cohen helped them to see that their desire to leave Andrew and become independent teachers stemmed from pride.

I could not let this pass. I pointed out that Cohen himself has said that he became fully liberated only after dissolving his relationship with his guru, Poonjaji. Shouldn’t he help his students achieve independence from him? Cohen shook his head. He reminded me that Poonjaji was imperfect; if you find a truly enlightened, perfect teacher, there is no reason to leave him.

""Let's say the Buddha was alive today. Let's say someone that great, that enlightened, that pure, that perfect, with such a great teaching, was still alive. I mean, could someone be too attached to someone like that?""

Yes, I replied. I did not see how you could be truly liberated while remaining dependent upon another human, even one as great as the Buddha.

But one cannot be too dependent upon a truly enlightened person, Cohen said, exasperated. ""The more attached you get to a person like that, the more free, literally, you become."" Cohen derided the importance that people in general, and westerners in particular, give to independence. He had begun slapping the table to emphasize points. ""Look,"" he said forcefully. ""Anybody""—Slap!—""who wants to be free is going to have to bend his knee."" The mind ""must surrender!"" Slap! ""However that happens, it doesn't really matter, as long as it happens."" Liberation cannot occur until the ego, the ""root of all evil,"" is obliterated.""

Andrew Cohen's organisation later collapsed and several books were published criticising him.
He was interviewed in a documentary that subsequently disappeared but it's reportedly being made into a film. 

Here's a video on how he has interpreted the collapse:

Now he has started teaching again and you can see his current outlook on things here:

cults,ipg1yo,Resources for healing from cults and religious trauma?,"Trigger Warning / NSFW : misogyny, violence, infant loss 

I (F29) grew up in a pretty obscure cult that was a sect of Pentecostalism. The rules for women were a mile long, and the prophet was also super misogynistic. 

He would say things like worldly women aren’t worth a clean bullet to kill them with, and his infant daughter died so she wouldn’t become a woman of the world. And a lot of other pretty messed up things. 

My question is, are there any good resources (books, podcasts, etc) that deal explicitly with religious trauma and recovering from cults? I have suffered from low self esteem, depression, and I’m sure some internal misogyny that I haven’t dealt with (even though I’d hate to admit it). 

I’m also questioning if I’m really atheist, or if I’m just refusing to deal with an uncomfortable subject. I have questions, but the thought of going to or joining any kind of organized church literally makes me nauseous."

Greetings r/cults,

Podcast promo here! We’ve been lurking around this sub for a while now, and have found this community to be extremely fascinating &amp; helpful for our research, but have been hesitant to self-promote for a long time. Well, we’re finally posting here after nearly two years of doing the show, so hopefully if you decide to listen, you’ll find us entertaining or interesting or at least distracting :)

Because of the format of our show- grey area between cult or not- some of our topics are much more or less “cultier” than others; I’ll list a few of our popular ones below.

If you’d like to reply to this thread, would love to hear your feedback.

If you pray to Michael Jackson , will he respond your prayer? Will he? No he wouldn't , same thing with Jesus. So i started to wonder , is my school weird , are them cultist?

The first CULT believes that minorities don't deserve rights, women deserve (very) slightly more, incite corruption in local government, and mass murders are discouraged but not punished.  


The second CULT demands high tribute from its followers, their leadership is much more disorganized than the first. They say that they treat women better, but still take advantage of them often, and they are \*very\* sensitive.  


And the scariest part is that you probably participated in their CULT, somehow, to some extent.

cults,ing840,General awareness of cults,"I would like to open a discussion about cults snd what to avoid. 

I'll go over some basics because sometimes religions can seem like cults and that is unfair to ridicule them that way, but there are cults that use religion as a basic uniting principal.

For one, chanting is more cult like than prayer. It is designed to create a euphoric happy feeling amongst the group. There might even be religious prayer intertwined, but the consensus is the chanting tends to be short phrases repeated over and over, while prayer has a centralized view around a particular person or diety. So, someone can pray to the virgin Mary and say a Hale Mary.
But chanting ""give us your milk"" over and over and then claiming to be talking about The mother's milk of the virgin Mary, is more of an indication of manipulation and cult like tactics.

Maybe people have better examples they would like to share.

The other aspects of cults is how they ask for support, and just like church they might want a donation, but there is a difference between a modest donation and someone signing over heirlooms and property to a church organization.

Cults also keep people apart from their families and sometimes become very controlling of their members when they want to leave. They might refuse to let them move on and reunite with family without some sort of backlash.

Beware of gangs and criminals because they are types of cults really. They methodically devalue the family support of people and entail that they owe their group or gang over a variety of political interests. 
Beware if you ever go to jail because bondsman are often a product of this behavior and it becomes all to easy to be taken advantage of over a night in jail.

Cults also tend to have no central existence. There's no center for them to identify as, like Christian or Jesuit, or Jewish or Mormon. They are secret and can exist inside many different organizations and in politics. In fact, sometimes it is like mainstream society to name the cult as they become identified, especially in cases of kidnapping and entrapment.
Cults would rather remain a secret.

A bunch of hippies in the wilderness holding charity events is rarely a concern for cult behavior although they might fit stereotypes of cults past.

Newer cults are more advanced and utilize technology as an interface. They may not even involve religion to the extent.  They want to actually keep and retain wealth as a secret group underneath the surface of everyday functions and aquisitions in the mainstream. 

I will be adding more to this discussion as I find time."

&amp;#x200B;

so I knew someone a while back who was getting quite involved with a personal development course based on Jungian psychoanalysis, particularly relating to the Jungian theory of archetypes.

&amp;#x200B;

It involves workshops and mens circles, not really my kind of thing. But it struck me as a bit suspect when I noticed that on an advertisment for a workshop he was doing, he was claiming to be a 'therapist in Jungian psychology' which sounded a bit too close to calling himself a psychotherapist, which he most certainly is not. He doesn't have any academic qualifications. Even worse, he hasn't even read any Jung (or he started to read one book but couldn't continue because it was too hard reading).

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gather, he has been to a few workshops and now has a title from the organisation so he can do his own workshops and also life-coaching online, which he gets paid minimum wage for, and I guess most of the money is going to the organisation.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know exactly what these workshops involve - probably lots of glorified hokey-pokey routines and group sharing, but I guess with a 'psychological' approach. He seemed to have modelled his personality around this programme, a personality which seemed quite fake and cringey. He also talked about being on a mission to raise the conciousness of mankind.

&amp;#x200B;

So the idea I was getting was that this programme is trying to be a Landmark-type-thing, with the pay-to-be-a-trainer-then-make-money-for-me financial model.

&amp;#x200B;

I will say that it certainly didn't seem as harmful as EST, so perhaps a lite version of that.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, this is the webpage for the group in question https://www.inner- [throne.com/](https://throne.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

As you see, lots of weird jargon, the claim that it gives better results than modern psychology in just 1 hour, mapping the archetypes to the shape of a pyramid...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not saying this is a cult (but maybe it could be the beginnings of one)...

&amp;#x200B;

But it got me interested in Jungianism as a new-religious-movement. After some research it seems that Jung is a pretty controversial figure.

I noted a book from the 90s called 'The Jung Cult' in which a researcher claims that Jungian Psychoanlysis was behind-th-scenes a new religious movement with Jung believing himself to be a reincarnation of one of Mithras(?), and other themes related to the mystery religions of ancient rome. (I didn't actually read the book, but I read an interview with the author which laid out a lot of the claims and evidence for it).

&amp;#x200B;

So really I'm just wondering, how culty is neo-jungianism (or even just jungianism) as a movement? have there been many 'Jung Cults'? What is the general opinion on the book 'The Jung Cult' and Jungain psychoanalysis?"

If a man began to question Randy, he would then try and get his wife to side with him, causing divorces.” There seems to be a lot more going on too! If anyone has heard anything about this any info would be greatly appreciated."
cults,im8n9s,A cult like experience in a county mental hospital,"Hi,   my name is blue eyes. I was given this name in a dream. I had an   experience in a county mental hospital that haunts me to this day.

In   june, i was sent to a county mental hospital. I prefer to keep the   location to myself, as at times i feel like they keep tabs on me. I was   sent there once after \*some\* sort of crime escalated in my house... i   dont know what happen exactly but police were called, called again, and   then i was deemed ""mentally unstable"" because whatever had happened  that  day really shook me. they threw me in this county hospital for no   reason other than that i was smarter than they were about what  happened.  This hospital was hell, i mean literally hell. I've been to  numerous  ones but this was like prison. The food was shit, dog shit.  They were  going to close soon, after years of being open, and so were  running out  of the dog shit food they served. They starved us by  drugging the juice,  making us pass out immediately and forget we hadnt  been served meals. I  lost about 20 pounds my second (also meaningless)  time i was there. i  had suspected that they may have these dart gun  type things they drugged  us with as well, but i am unsure. I just  remember feel a WHACK and BOOM  im out for hours.

Later   on in my first stay, i ran into the same person that had caused the   trouble at my house, in this same hospital. I was so scared he would end   me. I remember there was a man who worked there, they called him  satan.  I remember he was the only god that worked there. He had strange   ""horns"" that came from his head, and when he walked, it was more like a   leap. he also fascinated me, the way he fought demons and spirits. he   looked to have max stats. For whatever reason, that person i had   recognized from early also had some sort of role in this hospital. he   worked with that ""satan"" guy to try to end me. i was left on life   support for a while, that i remember. But I am a strong man, see, and i   have visions. I saw the face of a god, and i fell. But i always come   back, but i feel as though they killed me there, then put me in some   sort of first responder/virtual reality game to see if i could tell who   did it to me. I always get back up when i fall, i have a strong spirit.   But no, my spirit is gone now, i know part of me died in that  hospital. I  feel as though i have a mental foe, always following me. I  got my chips  and soda too, because i know The Truth. They put me in  some sort of  time machine there, and said, ""Icarus, you have dropped  your Staff. You  must die now.""

I   also have flashbacks of being shot with rubber bullets, and it feels as   though they are reappearing in my body now, in the present, because i   went through the Time Machine. They would also needlessly put us in   restraints, make us fight each other, and also remember some vague   sexual trauma. Like the (female) guards would dress up in attractive   attire, drop their bluetooth earbud, and then have sex with me and say,   blue eyes, you cant leave early, thats cheating!

I   remember being in the restraints, and they would say ""you can be   released from them if you guess \*this\* number on the door x feet away   from you. I am extremely psychic, you see. So they would test my powers,   and i could guess the door number correctly a few times, but not  every.  I also have a very good intuition on when the world will end,  which is  what somewhat attracts me to reddit. I think the minute they  put me in  that Time Machine i knew in my heart the world would end.

Lately   ive dealt with possession, it is very hard being psychic in these   times. The spirits just flow in and out of me. They bring me back, they   keep me alive in away.

I  have  wondered many times if they micro chipped my left ear, i have seen  cars  drop these EMP type of things around me. When they do drop them,  my  left ear rings, like i feel the blast in a way. Please someone  confirm  this for me! it is very confusing!

I   also see these dark figures on street corners, they look as though  they  training for something. I wonder if those are the demons that  haunt me.  That man, satan, with max stats, they surround him.

I   fear that foe will find me one day, that is why i wrote this. I do not   fear him, i am brave now, but i crave answers. Please, hear my story.

cults,im65jl,Think my mother is getting indoctrinated into a cult,"Im sorry, this is a bit long but I hope you'll read through it

So my mother found this ""guru"" guy on youtube who talks about our pagan religion that was persecuted. I myself follow that ""religion "" but the stuff this man is saying is off. He claimed that he was god (and we know a clear sign of a cult is claiming divinity), or like that our god is ""talking"" to him and telling him what to do.the thing is in our belief, that god does NOT talk to us not even the highest level shaman can talk to him so I'm already put off by him. He says a lot of other stuff and pretty much sh**s on other religions gods, saying their dead and stuff and that non believers are going to die cause they dont follow this ""religion"" since their god is already... dead. And that our people will lead the ""path"" to spiritual evolution and paradise. He even said that he was the one who sent the Corona virus and that he set up a ""protection barrier "" around our country to prevent the virus getting here.
Not only that, he's quoting HITLER as proof of the stuff hes saying and i DONT understand how that didnt raise a red flag in my mothers head.

So obviously I dont like him. At first it was just her watching his videos everyday but then she started parroting the stuff he says and saying hateful things that I dont think she even realises. She wont listen to me even tho I keep pointing out his inconsistencies that dont aligne with our belief. But now shes TALKING to him, shes on face call talking to him and I eavesdropped a bit and he was getting her sympathy talking about how people ridicule him and stuff and shes over here uplifting him and telling him how great his message and videos are and all that. Him sorta emotionally manipulating my mother like that seriously put me off as well. He hasn't asked for money or anything like that from what I know but a few days ago my mother asked my father for money pretty aggressively and didnt tell him what it is for so I'm just a bit worried about her possibly sneaking him money.

And what's concerning is that she wants to teach that stuff to my little brother, I wouldnt mind teaching him our belief but the stuff she wants to teach him is nothing more than a hateful and dogmatic version of our belief. Its twisted to the point that I might just become atheist again lol

Another thing, in our belief we have multiple deities and one is for earth her name is ""jer"" and shes a high ranking deity, but that man is completly disrespecting her saying that shes not ""jer"" but that god instead, hes teaching stuff that goes completly against our beliefs and not only disrespecting other religions but also our own deities. 
I had the liberty of not having anything forced onto me, I was even atheist for a large chunk of my life and I just wanted to reconnect with my ancestors beliefs but I dont want anything forced onto my brother. I want him to have that freedom to choose as well and I really dont mind teaching him the beliefs of our ancestors but I'm worried since she wants to teach him what that man preaches. She never interfered in my beliefs before and that allowed me explore freely, but now all of a sudden she really wants to convert my brother into this as well.

Another thing I found is that hes tried running for president 2 times before and has a small organisation, I dont know but I heard that political intrest and lobbying as well as a power structure organisation is a sign of a cult, I seriously hope I'm just overthinking.
I'm really struggling to find daming evidence on him being a con man so, please advice me on this"
cults,im1im7,Acellus Cult:Teaching the youth of today: Part 2,
cults,im0nxg,Acellus Cult:Teaching the youth of today(PART 1 Since I think it wont't let me type more),"So this is gonna be pretty far out there... However from only two days of looking into this, I can't seem to find out the bottom line.Each door that I open just leads to two more,and honestly I don't think I am capable to do this on my own.Let me start by saying this is the first time I have ever posted to reddit. or for that matter been on here longer than a couple of minutes. Anyways, two days ago I came to this website to look for...You guessed it CULTS. And so far within a matter of moments a came across a post saying"" **Cult running distance learning platform** "" and that instantly peaked my interest. And just like that all it took was one search to see the news about the program as a whole. (I'll try to add pics if i can figure out how and add the links)

When you check the news tab you will be greeted by a number of news outlets talking about this program.Looking into them you will find that the education department in Hawaii is going to stop using this program. Why???? Well it's due to the fact that some of the material is a little ""sketchy"".If you look it up there are some questions that are really odd(all also try to add these).Most of these questions can be found still and shy away from the real facts at hand.

DISCLAIMER:YES THEY ARE STILL WRONG BUT ARE MAKING IT HARDER TO PIN THESE PEOPLE FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS.

Now past that I found something very interesting on their facebook page. It's a post with 5 ""sketchy"" things that they were gonna get rid of so that the program could be more PC. Now within in those 5 things is one that opened up and lead me to find some of the weirdest things that just have no context.

DISCLAIMER 2: THIS IS NOT AN ARG THIS IS REAL AND CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE.PLEASE DO NOT START TO THINK OF IT AS A GAME, I FEAR THAT IF WE LOOK AT IT THAT WAY IT WILL BE TAKE AWAY FROM THE OVER ALL REALNESS OF THIS.

So when looking at the 4th problem with the site they mention "" 4. Tagged as unprofessional: A ""screen test"" video of Dr. Pajet Monet was pulled from the Acellus Courseware Development system and published on social media as a bad example of Acellus lessons.  The video was never published, never intended to be part of a lesson, not filmed in the Acellus studio, and was never vetted by the Acellus Review Board. This video could not be deleted from a course because it never was part of any course, and never was shown to any student. "". This grabbed my attention so fast because of just the oddness of """"Screen Test"""" and when trying to look up any information....I came up with zero. Except the name Dr.Pajet Monet. So of course I had to find out who this person is.(you could honestly make a whole other post just about her, But i'll try to give as much info as I have available). with a simple search of the name you will find three very distinct paths to follow: 1.""[https://www.pajet.com/](https://www.pajet.com/) which takes you to her own website where you are able to see who she is and one message she puts out about her self, And her great achievements like ""running her own IT site"" ( ComTech Networking ) and the fact that she got her phd from "" International Academy of Science "" which I will come back to at a later down the post. So besides that there is a video that you have to see to believe,but does help connect some dots later on. Ill try to explain a little about the video but I do strongly suggest watching it yourself. The video is of kids and one adult besides pajet looking extremely sad. Pajet then goes own to talk about how we all feel the ""dark""/""back shadow"" of guilt and other dark words(this I will also come back to) then says that in our soul we have these feelings. She then opens her hands releasing three ""ORBS"" that fly around her almost like they are alive. Pure white orbs fly around to all the children making them happy :) . Now I kid you not this is just some wild stuff.

Now lets move on to ""[http://pajetmonet.blogspot.com/](http://pajetmonet.blogspot.com/)  Which is her own personal blog that dates back until 2012(the dates are VERY important as it helps paint how all this came to be.)Now nothing was that odd about it at first except the gap from 2012-2015 as of 2012 she went to a lot of baseball games and actually got some fame due to the amount of games that the royals in Kansas city won. But only when she was at the games. The last post gives me some incite due to the fact that she is standing with the founder of ""ACELLUS"" Roger Billings who we will also come back to at a later point(also to note he is not mentioned at all in that post which is weird because of how ""famous"" he is . Now after that post there is a whole one year gap. Following is no more posts about base ball but instead ""ACELLUS"".  which in 2018 she got her own personal class known as ""ESP""(no you don't get to talk to ghosts that be way cooler than what the class really is .) ESP or emotional, social &amp; physical ed.

One of the big parts of ""ACELLUS"" is Billings """"TED TALKS"""" called ""talk science"" where he is joined mostly by his co-host Pajet. Where most of  the talks are about science, some seem to push for this idea of love/unity. Which is a good message... but not to large groups of mainly impressionable kids.

Taking a break from the talks I want to talk about the"" third lovely door of pajet"". ""[https://www.fireangel.com/](https://www.fireangel.com/) "" which is where the fun truly begins. With out even scrolling down you can literally read how this is a cult. Where she says how grateful she is that students have said they like the course and that they should ""Reach out"" to other kids and teach them the ways of the ""FireAngel"" Now that is only the tip of the iceberg with Fireangel. Where she says that anyone can be a fireangel. And in fact shes right. Thanks to a great sight called ""way back machine "" [https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/)"

cults,ilnldp,International Order of Rainbow for Girls IS A cult..,"Hello, I am reposting what another person has said about rainbow to further people's knowledge of This situation.


Hey, spread this around the IORG members. It's a warning.

My grandma was OES. My grandpa was a Mason. Every male in the family was in Demolay and became Masons. My aunt was the first one to be in Rainbow in the 70's, and she took her sister (my mother) in the group with her. They loved the group, got scholarships, and had an overall positive experience with it, and both joined OES when they took their majority in Rainbow. They both had no hesitation about having my cousin and I join as pledges and then full members when we got old enough. 

I'm now 21 and this group had given me nothing but trauma and clinically diagnosed PTSD. I was promised a family, I was told I would be a leader and I would honor God, and I would leave this group with many life long friends and useful skills. Haha, no.

I was bullied throughout my teenage years, age 11 - 15, I was talked about behind my back, picked on in front. of the room, humiliated, and. publicly shamed. My weight, my acne,  the way I dressed, when I dyed my hair, my ""attitude"", and nearly everything that a normal teenager deals with was brought into the lime light. ""Oh, they're just teenage girls, it's normal to be picked on a little,"" you may be thinking, but nope. The adults did this alongside the girls. They encouraged it, even. They wanted their pack to have this mindset that they were better than everyone else. You either became one of them, or you were kicked to the curb. 

The most horrendous thing I remember happening is that of the girls from another assembly revealed to me that she had been sexually assaulted by a Rainbow dad/Mason. It had been years since it happened and he had absolutely no consequences because if she came forward and took this to court, she would not have been allowed to be Grand Worthy Advisor. He even kept his position, and the whole thing was kept a secret, because he was the brother in law of a Supreme Assembly member. This scared me to death. I had been assaulted before in my life and now I was at risk of it happening again in this group. 

When I was ready to graduate high school I realized that this group hadn't helped me at all. I had absolutely no idea what I should do with my life except become ""Grand Worthy Advisor"" and ""make God and my family proud."" My one friend I had outside of this group helped me plan what college to go away to, against my mother advisor's advice. I finally had the courage to leave this group after the adults had turned my few friends against me and I was forced to leave everything behind or face their legal team for slander ( I had made a facebook post talking about what I went through in this group).  

My cousin now has a daughter who is a pledge for this group. I fear for her.

Let IORG die out. 

TLDR: Trauma. Sexual Assault. Lawsuits. PTSD. Let IORG die."
cults,illu8v,I think I was in a budding therapy cult.,"I ended with my therapist of over a decade recently, and it wasnt quite there yet in cult status but it was headed in that direction. The therapist was a personality theorist and would push his theories on us. I started seeing him when I was a teenager and eventually went into the field because of him and got my masters in social work. We were considered ""a community"" of my therapists ""people"" and my therapist sarcastically called himself ""The Great (his name)"". His clients, two clients partners, his supervisees, his proteges, and one of his proteges clients were in the group. He would say things like we know the truth about therapy and we can only trust outside professionals recommended by our community. He started getting aggressive with the homework after grouo and shaming us if we didnt do it. He insisted it wasn't a cult because we maintained our individuality and there wasn't a penalty for leaving but honestly I don't believe that. I believed it was his way or the highway for so long. I have been dealing with on and off suicidal ideation and he encouraged me to keep going because ""im going to be a world class therapist"" and basically I was fulfilling his legacy and it was okay because he used to get triggered all of the time too. I legit did not come to him at one point during one of my episodes because he said me him and my protege were all breaking down and I didn't want to bother him. I finally fired him because he was trying to get me to do trauma work i wasnt ready for and he told me he was tired of me dictating my sessions and i told him i was tired of him. I couldn't do therapy with him anymore because I realized he became my mentor and he was so invested in me fulfilling his legacy. Realizing that this guy I've idolized for so long was so enmeshed in me is messing me up."

Hey. What do Hot Fuzz, Resident Evil, Evil Dead, die-hard Trump fans, Nazis, Scientologists, abusive cops, and some workers in nightmarish black market scenes from Max Payne have in common?

I occasionally run from cultists who are basically a combination of them in my dreams. It all starts with people who appear to be totally normal on the surface. Like pleasant-looking old librarians. Until they start saying weird things.

Thinking they can be talked out of their toxic beliefs, I give their level of ignorance the benefit of doubt, and try to subtly slip in a word of reality. They give a “Karen glare.” I look around and realize they’re all over the place. A single one goes on a power trip trying to taunt me while wearing a big smile, and then attacks me. Much like a violent bully. I’m forced into cutting a bitch back when they get too physically dangerous.

Following me defending myself, I end up running from an increasingly coalescing angered swarm of their cultist peers. Out for my blood.

I wake up. Like I did today again.

cults,ikpz76,Spirit Science,"So a few years ago I met this guy (we'll call him Max) in my theatre group.  We bonded a lot, he was super chill and funny, and we liked the same video games and would go see movies together a lot.  I found out at our second group meetup that he used to be a member of Spirit Science like me.  We started talking about our experiences and realized that we were both did extremely dangerous things via instruction from Jordan, the leader.  I never thought what happened to me was that bad, but he sort of opened my eyes.

I had joined and was a devout follower.  I started holding racist views that I didn't realize were racist, like infantilizing Jewish people and fetishising cultures and practices from across Asia.  I started spending my money on bogus treatments for physical and spiritual health.  I stopped taking my medications that I needed for my chronic illness and depression.  I had a organic raw vegan diet.  I began fasting.  Eventually it spiraled into an eating disorder.  I started hallucinating, experiencing paranoia, was extremely fatigued and always in pain due to my chronic illnesses, and had very little money because I was spending it all on bogus treatments and organic fruits and vegetables, and then I felt like I was expected to make more money to buy psychedelics and go on trips to the Carribean with Jordan on a trip he was sponsored by to basically trip for five days.  I felt like a failure.  I was told that if I was still physically or mentally ill even after eating organic and raw vegan and abstaining big pharma, that it was still my fault and that I had spiritual blockage.  It wasn't until I heard him talk about Teal Swan and looked into her that I left.  When I saw that she was advocating for suicide normalization and saying that it was completely okay, that was my wakeup call.

Max, on the other hand, still considered himself a member.  He still followed a lot of their beliefs but seemed to be better off.  It wasn't until I found out he had been drinking crystal water at their request that I was concerned, because he was regularly drinking water that had crystals soaked in them.  Now some argue that this is okay with certain crystals like quartzes (amethyst, jasper, citrine, etc), but he was drinking malachite crystal water, which has copper in it.  He wasn't told how to go about making safe crystal water, just to have a crystal sit in a water bottle and then drink it.  Max didn't realize that if he didn't stop he would end up getting severe copper poisoning.  Thankfully, he didn't somehow.  But after that incident he left.

Now I don't think Spirit Science is as bad as other cults like Scientology or Quiverfull.  They don't practice excommunication, they have (bullshit) disclaimers saying ""listen to your body"" and that they're not claiming anything works for legal purposes.  They still pass the BITE model, however.

Behavior - they tell people how to live their lives in multiple ways, from telling you how to eat, what drugs to take, and even what color to paint your bedroom walls to clear your chakras.  I was told to not give money to homeless people and to give them crystals instead because it would benefit them more.

Information - They use bogus scientific articles to support their claims for spirituality.  They'll misquote articles or use debunked sources to support claims like saying the moon is hollow or that Hebrews are descended from aliens.

Thought - They push the belief that your health issues are a result of your negative thoughts.  That's about the extent of it, but that shit hurt.

Emotion - They're really big on love bombing and subtle guilt tripping.  I remember in a video where they were talking about eating raw and organic where someone mentioned living in an area where organic raw vegan food is not readily available.  He started to guilt trip her into thinking she wasn't doing enough by saying that she should be growing her own food if she can't buy it, and I don't think this guy knows how much food you have to grow to feed yourself alone.

I know I don't have nearly as bad of an experience as others, but I think that the presence of internet cults needs to be examined.  Especially now when we're in such a time of uncertainty and so many young people are feeling a sense of hopelessness and loss while simultaneously showing interest in spirituality, we all need to make sure that new age stuff we see online isn't anything more nefarious."

Religions such as the Buddhist game of Samsara and visionaries like Stephen Hawking, Phillip K Dick and Elon Musk concur it is more likely than not this is one grand simulation. To support this point Rizwan takes us from the beginnings of 8 bit gaming to the downloadable open worlds of today. If our computing power persists in accordance with Murphys Law our supercomputers will render simulations with NPCs of a greater intellect than you and I! Has it already happened?

cults,ikjih1,Mom is in an online evangelical cult run by Bette Davis' daughter B.D. Hyman,"So there is a lot to unpack here.

I'll start by saying that last year, I started noticing this strange behavior in my mom, and the incredibly strange things she would say to me.

For background, my mom is 48 years old and recently divorced. Back when we were still living as a family together with my dad and younger brother prior to the divorce, our living environment was always chaotic because of my brother's drug addiction. On top of that, she was unemployed and stuck in a bad marriage. Had maybe one friend, who she was not even that close to. So kind of an easy target as far as cults go. Somebody living a stressful, unstable, unsatisfying life with few connections to the outside world. She had always had Christian evangelical leanings, so unfortunately I didn't catch on right away that some of the beliefs she was espousing were anything out of the ordinary.

She learned about B.D. Hyman's ministry thanks to an article online about a book B.D. wrote about her mother, Bette Davis, where she claimed Bette Davis practiced witchcraft and abused her and was an all-around terrible woman. (Whether or not you believe these allegations are true isn't relevant here, I'm not going to address them.) My mom started watching her ministry youtube videos, of which there are tons of, each hours long. She also revealed to me she would occasionally talk to this woman over the phone and would ask her things like which media was okay to consume.

Eventually this lead to a whole slew of weird behavior and a total shift in beliefs and temperament. She started to believe she could heal things or make things happen just using her mind, because apparently B.D. told her that she was able to redirect a tornado once using her strong belief in god. She suddenly frowned upon going to doctors, which she did not used to do. She started to swear off all media, claiming it was satanic and meant to lead people astray from god. She talked down on other Christians constantly, saying they didn't know The Truth like she did. Her beliefs suddenly became incredibly black and white, and almost every conversation we had would inevitably turn into an argument because I fundamentally disagree with everything this cult stands for, and disagreeing is not allowed. She started to idolize the idea of financial wealth and excess in a way she didn't used to. She would constantly threaten to kick me out even though I'm disabled and rely on her for financial support and have virtually nowhere else to go. She would also claim I could just ""cure"" my incurable chronic illness at will if I would just change my belief set to hers and pray to god all the time and that the fact that I wasn't doing that meant that I ""loved being miserable."" Her empathy towards me and other people was completely squandered.

And then the distancing from family and friends started. One day she said to me, ""God told me he would financially bless me, but he said I have to move away from you first."" (I was very concerned about this before I knew just what in the fuck was actually going with her. At first I thought she was suffering from schizophrenia, because normal people do not just claim they get messages like this from god.) Eventually she stopped talking to her mom, the only person other than me who she talked to with any regularity. She stopped responding to texts from my brother, and wouldn't even let him visit the apartment like he used to from time to time, claiming she didn't want him to ""curse her household"" or ""block her from spiritual blessings."" Eventually that rule was extended to my friends, too.

She would shut herself up in her room suddenly for days at a time, and when questioned about anything she would get defensive and respond with hostility. She would use the word ""blessed"" to describe her living situation regularly even though she was clearly not happy and running out of divorce money to support herself. She would use other strange phrases and terminology, like ""yoked to unbelievers"" and ""the church is not the bride"" which she would repeat when given the opportunity.

When we would get into arguments she'd become incredibly mean and nasty and call me shit like ""the antichrist"" and tell me I was satanic etc etc etc. Even when I was going out of my way to be nice to her and follow her rules she still acted like I was possessed and deserving of abuse. Nothing nice I did or said to her made any dent in her screwed up ideology and views of the outside world. It was entirely pointless to talk to her about anything other than the weather or maybe food, because anything else turned into an argument. Eventually I got tired of the abuse and just stopped talking to her completely, for my own mental well-being.

Last December I finally put the pieces together and figured out she was showing signs of brainwashing and realized [B.D. Hyman's ministry is a cult](http://bdhyman.com/finding-a-church/). Among her [ministry's tenets](http://bdhyman.com/tenets/) are tithing, and apparently 10% of any new income you receive is the minimum. It is not optional. She has hours and hours of free audio lectures on dropbox as advertised on her ministry's website and I listened to the one about finances (*Our Financial Covenant*) wherein she explicitly says she doesn't care if you're struggling financially, you need to tithe 10% of anything you earn or receive, even as a gift, or you won't receive blessings. She basically runs this evangelical prosperity gospel type cult, where she says Christian followers are not meant to suffer, but be blessed and ""live like kings"" on earth. Her big claim is that anything that you tithe to her church, you will receive back 100 fold from god as a reward. She uses this phrase, ""rebuke the devourer"" which is just code for telling people to not pay their bills or insurance, because it should be spent on her church and your belief in god means you don't need insurance. Y i k e s.

The whole thing is incredibly financially predatory. And I've already seen a letter on my mom's desk from the car insurance company saying she didn't make the last payment. I'm seriously worried we're going to end up with utilities shut off at some point and evicted because I don't know how much money she's handing this woman.

So far I haven't seen anybody talk about this ministry being a cult, and I have a feeling it's a fairly small cult from the sound of things. I found a [page of reviews for her actual physical ministry](http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3723058357/kings-corner-fellowship-charlottesville), and it sounds like she wasn't super successful at wrangling up followers that way. Unsurprisingly, most of the reviews are negative. So she seems to have shifted most of her focus online.

Has anyone else had any experience with or heard anything about this cult? I wish there were more resources to help me expose it for what it is."

I have C.P..T.S.D,  I was illegaly imprisoned tortured and raped for 6.5 years as a child on the island of Jersey in the English channel. For 65 years this island thats not that far off the coast of France is privatly owned by the Queen of England.These Islands chief of which and largest is Jersey.

&amp;#x200B;

This Island /s are immune from E.U human rights laws and English law.

This is the holiday destination of Jimmy Savile child rapist murdera and canibal and necrophile.

The ""Staff"" at the instituation I was in all come from majore ciies through out the England 1 from Manchester 1 from Scotland 1 from Wales 1 from Newcastle...as you can see they came a fair distance to be in this pacific place.

Jersey since 1944-45, by its own admition. has been unable to stop more than 4 illegal child prisons and 10's of child abuse institutions from hospital wings in the one and only hospital on the island ion that entire time to such things as ""cottage"" homes , this where a man and a women like a surgate parents look after no more than 4 children. [https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2015/07/31/im-sorry-for-regime-of-abuse-by-maguires/](https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2015/07/31/im-sorry-for-regime-of-abuse-by-maguires/) this one of the homes I used to go to in the summer holidays.

The island was and probably still is scattered with these types of abuse homes.

[https://youtu.be/gQB7XJ7OhaE](https://youtu.be/gQB7XJ7OhaE) , or you may remember this [https://youtu.be/lq6lJsBz9UY](https://youtu.be/lq6lJsBz9UY) were we were hung up and had copper wire tied and wrapped around our legs and other bits then elctricuted.

&amp;#x200B;

The point I am getting at is if you follow all the so called ""staff"" and check were they are from...they are all in or related to entire familes in the Freemasons. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry). They claim to be abrotherly faturnaity....but they are not...their members include such as the yorkshire ripper...peter sutcliff [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter\_Sutcliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sutcliffe) , [https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-frank-bruno-reveals-1430910](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-frank-bruno-reveals-1430910) here is jimmy savile with peter sutrcliff left performing the freemasons handshake with boxer frank bruno.

They are a cult.....they claim to be a secret organisation...well its not much of a secret.

The former deputy head of my last institute of illegal confinment is now the head of a school for Vulnrable children in Southampton.

I have 3 differant police stations telling me its not a crime for her to work with children including offsted (gouverment watch body for school standerderds) and the local council here she is [https://www.polygon.southampton.sch.uk/welcome-to-our-school/](https://www.polygon.southampton.sch.uk/welcome-to-our-school/).

&amp;#x200B;

I got paid £4000 for reporting my rape as a child and £10,000 for being illegaly imprisoned for 247 days or the like..and that took me 30 years to get!! they claimed you couldnt claim for the hours you were asleep there.She earns more in a year than any of us got for being illegaly imprisoned tortured raped denied health care and denied an education.

So how is it possible for medical records for 30 years of my own life to go missing in the one and only hospital on the island? and then how for 35 years before I was even born was the same thing going on?

Its simple but you wont like it...it what the island is for...it was designed for this.

Out of its 100,000 of inhabitants...not 1 EVER has punched slapped or harmed one of these abusers that still live on the same island thats only 5 miles by 9.

The numbers dont lie...its a controled isle by a cult...the freemasons."

I'd love to hear about your experiences with the cult.","I personally find the Ramtha persona to be so disgustingly cringe that I feel like I need to take a shower after watching JZ Knight. My grandma raised me and talked about him constantly. I had kids books about Ramtha, and my grandma has all of JZ's books.

Aside from Ramtha, my grandma was a member of the church of Scientology. She believes all the negative things about Scientology are made up by the government. All negative things about Ramtha are also made up by the government because they know it's the truth. 

I believe that she had ties at one point to Heaven's Gate, but she will not admit to any such thing just like she'll tell you she's never smoked a single marijuana in her life. Mhm.. 

The thing I hate most about Ramtha is the belief that you choose everything in your life. My mom was less than good to me growing up. My grandma (who is super nice, btw) will tell me that I chose my mom for a reason. I told her if I had a choice, I'd be a Koch. If I'm having a bad day, she says that I create my own reality. This applies to bad luck, pain, etc. Things that I literally can't control. You can't get food poisoning if you create the reality that the food won't get you sick.

I'm sure it's meant to be reassuring, but I find it highly dismissive. 

Aside from that, she believe that all diseases are caused by parasites (re: The Cure for All Diseases by  Hulda Regehr Clark), all vaccines are bad and can be detoxed by drink lots of water, you can only drink distilled water, you should never take iron because iron is a metal and not meant to be consumed, all modern medicine is evil.

Secure website with a new train of thought to the human mind"
cults,ijnuut,I found an unlisted YouTube video that led me to a cult that was supposed to have been shut down by the FBI over 30 years ago.,"I found an unlisted YouTube video posted in 2018 in a playlist that led me to a cult that was shut down in the late 80's. It seems like they're still active today.

I've seen one or two posts in other places about this video, but nothing that really helped me learn anything about it. Those posts were buried pretty deep.

It was around midnight and I was on a discord call with one of my close friends. We were sending each other weird looking YouTube videos that we found, some of them hilarious and some just outright absurd. It was sort of a contest to see who could find the weirdest video just from looking at the thumbnail and title. I was going through a playlist of videos with weird Russian titles and creepy thumbnails. I randomly picked one. Boy, I sure chose the wrong one.

The video was posted in 2018 by a guy named Stuart Silverstone. He didn't have any other videos like this (or maybe he did, but they were also unlisted) posted on his channel. The video started with a weird picture of a heart zooming in on it while it shook erratically. Then it jumped to a guy hitting the head of someone who was in a canvas bag inside of a bathtub with a handgun. This footage was sped-up. The next shot was the guy lifting the head of the person in the bathtub. She (for some reason I imagine her being a woman, so I'll give her that pronoun. Same goes for the guy.) had a mask over her face, which was weird since it was already covered by the canvas bag. The mask was a red mask, and looked kind of like one of those demons in traditional Japanese art. The bathtub was also full of water now, red, presumably from the woman's blood.

If you so desire, here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K35h7dZncs&amp;feature=emb\_err\_woyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K35h7dZncs&amp;feature=emb_err_woyt)

The rest of the video was a bunch of cuts. It cut to a blaring red light, and then to a weird concrete wall, and back to the woman, who was now moving slightly. We get another cut the the red light, and then the screen goes black and the video's done. My friend had stopped watching after the first scene with the woman getting hit with the gun, and I can't blame him. There were numbers and letters in the description. They read as such:

34.646038, -82.453846 FQL FWZUT S YXTDZY VDBXT LXUUWF HFLMESUVC AMXSCX S RDK RUSAJ GDADWZV TWK

The numbers were coordinates, and I'll go into that in a minute, but the letters were indecipherable by my friend and I. We went to a few websites and plugged it into different ciphers, but in the end, didn't really come up with anything of meaning. The title was also a strange string of numbers:

TDSUC UMTW KXW AXTKM

We weren't able to reap anything from this, except for that the two first words came out as BLACK BOX in one of the ciphers.

After plugging in the coordinates, we found a little cabin next to a river in a town called Pelzer, SC. There wasn't much else that came from this. There was also a link in the description of the video, which I didn't click due to being scared of whatever the hell it could be. Maybe it would track me or something.

Through googling the guys name, we got lead to a website describing a cult called the ""Finders Cult"".

I'll link the website here: [https://spidercatweb.blog/the-finders-cult](https://spidercatweb.blog/the-finders-cult)

It's a weird website, with more un-decoded words and a bunch of videos that have been taken down as of now. It gave some information on the cult, but also a lot of weird nonsense.

Finally, after googling the Finders Cult, I came to a few news sites that talked about how the FBI declassified over 600 pages about a group called the Finders, a cult involved in child trafficking in the late 80's. What freaked me out is that this video was posted in 2018, and supposedly the cult was shut down long ago. Fortunately, this didn't end up affecting me in any way, but it made me wonder if the victim in the video was a child, since they're involved in child sex trafficking. Who knows. It was a really creepy, fucked up thing to find, and if anyone knows anything about it, I'd love a more in-depth explanation.

Edit: here's the FBI declassification. [https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders](https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders)

Edit 2: Here are some creepy quotes from a website I found breaking down the declassification and the website itself.

[https://finderscult.wordpress.com/](https://finderscult.wordpress.com/)

The strange men with a herd of young kids were brought in and questioned in Tallahassee and the van they traveled in was impounded. It was noted that one of the men did not cooperate at all, and when questioned appeared to go into a “trance-like state”. Questioning of the children lead to some interesting results. A lot of answers came from the oldest child Mary, as some of the younger ones were non-verbal. When asking Mary what her last name was, she replied, “Which one?” The children seemed unaware of modern technology, electricity, hot water and were curious to even the most simple contraptions such as staplers.

They did not attend school and said the men were their teachers. When asked what the men taught them, the oldest said they are taught “How to play games.” They said they lived with their mothers, although were not allowed \*inside\* of the house. They lived in the van and in tents. They traveled often, sometimes by plane. They were on a trip away to “wean” the youngest from their mothers. Officers noted that the youngest ones had no diapers on and had been taught that the ground outside was their bathroom. One apparently went potty directly on the floor in the questioning room. When asked who the leader of the group is, the oldest child had replied “the Game Caller.” When offered food, one child consumed 8 bananas and an orange. They all seemed extremely hungry.

The McMartin preschool is then documented to have many tunnels underneath it and the children were able to accurately describe entrances and exits. There were electrical switches in the school that did not work for that purpose, but rather sounded alarm alert systems. Classroom 3 contained no doorknob but solely a deadlock bolt. In the tunnels, pentagrams were found carved into the walls and on plates, along with 100 animal bones. The owner of this preschool was indicted; the trial lasted six years and then in 1993 all charges were dropped due to “lack of evidence”. In all these situations, it’s been said that no one ever ‘saw the child abuse against victims’ and therefore prosecution was ‘difficult’ to prove. 

Honestly, I could post the contents of this document and it would be a fucking creepy story in and of itself. Jesus Christ. This is REAL.

cults,iiwybz,Looking to know more about prison cults,"More specifically, I want to learn about cults that either started in prison, or are based in prisons. I know they have to be a thing, they're already super isolated and I know that a lot of people have been radicalized in prisons, but the only one I know about is the Symbiosis Liberation Army. I've tried using search engines to find more, but literally none of the results have been relevant, no matter how many different ways I try to phrase it.

I'm also willing to settle for names of cult leaders that still operate out of prison, like Warren Jeffs. Any help is much appreciated!"
cults,iiw0cq,Question concerning the horse killings in France.,"I came across an article about how there is a “horse serial killer” on the countryside in France. Various bones are removed (no muscle or meat is taken) and the right ear is always cut off. And most of the time an eyeball. Everything is done very surgical. 

So I guess what I’m wondering is if you guys know anything about cults sacrificing horses. Or any ritual that matches these descriptions. 

Thank you. If y’all need more info I can link the reddit post that I found concerning this."

&gt;Hello, nice to meet you  
&gt;  
&gt;I am a Falun Gong practitioner abroad  
&gt;  
&gt;My friend, I’m a Falun Gong practitioner. Because the Communist Party persecutes Falun Gong, it slanders Falun Gong, lies and makes many people misunderstand Falun Gong, so I want to tell you that Falun Dafa is Buddhism, and you will get blessings and peace if you maintain good thoughts about Buddhism. Many people hate Falun Gong because of the ""Tiananmen self-immolation."" Actually the self-immolation is fake  
&gt;  
&gt;Friends, do you know? ""Falungong has been spread in more than 100 countries. Practicing Falun Gong has improved physical health and morality. It is popular everywhere. Why is it only in China that Falun Gong is persecuted. Not in other countries in the world? Hong Kong belongs to China, though. But Falun Gong in Hong Kong is also very free. Don’t you think it’s strange?  
&gt;  
&gt;We have been clarifying the truth with you about the 20 years of persecution. I just hope you understand what good and evil is. I believe you will distinguish between good and evil, good and bad, right and wrong. Hope you calmly consider  
&gt;  
&gt;Because the history of the CCP is a history of murder, various political movements have killed countless Chinese compatriots. It is anti-god and anti-world, and it promotes atheism, But in the end will get karma. Since the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, various movements have continued one after another. Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns, the Cultural Revolution, the June 4th massacre of college students, the persecution of Falun Gong, and the harvesting of organs from Falun Gong practitioners.  
&gt;  
&gt;Did you know that the CCP always deceives the people

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: How did you add me? Do I have a group chat with you in common?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm sorry to disturb you. I just want to bring you something better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before the Wenchuan earthquake, SARS, floods and other natural disasters and man-made calamities, many kind-hearted mainland compatriots quit the party and sincerely pray “Falun Dafa is good, truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance are good”, then they escape from disaster and became safe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quitting the Communist Party is very simple. I can help you get a pseudonym and quit the CCP, the Communist Youth League, and the Young Pioneers organization. It will not affect your work and life, this is shown to the god. The god is watching you. Believe in the blessing of gods and buddhas, we can be safe when the collapse comes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quit the ccp are related to your life. I hope you will consider it calmly.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ll name you.... .*Xian Xu*.... Quit ccp, okay?  
&gt;  
&gt;Quit the CCP is related to your life.  I only want to give you safety, as long as you say ""yes"", you will be safe, you won't lose anything, God will protect you when disasters come.  
&gt;  
&gt;friend! In order to keep you safe, Please quit the CCP quickly.  As long as you agree that I will help you get a pseudonym and send it on falungong website, no need to tell the Communist organization, please select the number you want to quit and send it to me, you can double-select.

I told her I would help her get out if she wanted help and she said she did so two weeks later she left him and came with me. 

She was being followed and tracked by people the entire time we were together but she knew who they were. They were following her around for sexual acts. 

I think the whole thing was a trick to use me for unknown purposes. 

She traveled with me from Florida to California while I worked but believe it or not we were actually tracked and followed the entire time. Being tracked and followed finally ended when I ended things with her. 

There was a device installed in my car that was integrated with the GPS. It was hooked up to the stereo and was feeding us Bluetooth signals from people close by and I think it also fed signals to them. 

Was this a cult?? If so which one? 

I think she used to be a victim but is now a Willing participant in whatever that was. She said one time something about a ritual. And she was always trying to go outside around 8am and 7pm to flash weird hang signals at them. 

I’m just looking for answers. I know I’m not crazy.

cults,ihwn6o,I WANT TO START A CULT,"Now I want to offer a disclaimer by saying this post is by no means meant to offend or make light of those who have been abused or traumatized by cult members or otherwise. 

The Why: A close friend of mines suffered at the hands of an abuser (while we were children). She never mentioned this to me or anyone for that fact until we were about 15 or so(I'm 33 now). I came to realize the family member knew of the abuse but seemed to have an "" It is what it is"" attitude about it. I went with her to speak with her family members about the abuse. She confronted them but they seemed nonchalant about it. even her mother went as far as to say he (the abuser) ""is just like that sometimes"" and that she (my friend) probably wouldn't even remember it. She remembers all of it. She recalled to me a time where she was insistent on hanging out with me but ignored her to go rollerblade with some friends. it was a harmless snub to me but she was trying to get away from him. I didn't understand why she was being so insistent and it annoyed me because she didn't do the things the rest of the boys did. She knew it would get worse if she couldn't find somewhere to be while her mom was out of the house. There was a time when we were drinking and he (the abuser) caught us. it wasn't a big deal to him he knew we drank he never said anything but he'd take whatever was left and kept it for himself. But this time he hung around making inappropriate ""guy Jokes"" I laughed it off I didn't want to seem like I wasn't cool. I didn't know what to do so I just said I was too drunk and needed to go to sleep. I pretend that I was knocking out figured he'd leave because it was boring. He kept going and assaulted her. I pretended I didn't remember anything. she didn't even mention it. I was a coward because I wasn't that drunk and I knew full well there was something hugely wrong yet because she didn't mention it I used that as an excuse for me being a coward and not helping. I realized I had let her down in the worst way possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The What: I want to start a cult to help those who need a place to get away from that type of abuse. and expose those that are committing it. While most wouldn't use the term cult there are some aspect that I'm sure are illegal which are:

1. Punching and/or exposing Nazi's, Pedo's, abusive spouses And overall shitty people. 

2. Extorting said shitty people to help us find more shitty people to continue to expose and/or punch them.

3. Covering up for the ones who accomplish their goal in punching and/or exposing said shitty people. 

while these things are Morally sound IMO they certainly aren't legal. hence why this aspect is definitely  to be seriously considered before joining. while there's no forced obligation to do these things it does go a long way in establishing the trust needed to effectively grow this cult. if I receive at least 10 interested people we can form an official (secret) FB page or other platform given a positive vote by the members. also there will be lighter hearted aspects so everything isn't always so serious. Perhaps BBQ's Netflix watch Parties and just a place to exist speak without being judged. 

&amp;#x200B;

The When: I'd aim for this to be in full swing by November 11th. gives time for potential members to really think on membership go over ideas for growth and get comfortable building processes on how we should go about doing things. but id like to know what you guys and gals think."

And let me give a disclaimer here this is by no means meant to make fun of or insult anyone who has been abused at the hands of a cult or otherwise traumatized by one. now it wouldn't be a religious or political one per say. but maybe a bit of an ideological cult I guess. I want to center it around punching and/or exposing nazi's, pedo's, abusive spouses and overall unsavory people. Then go out to eat afterwards. Now I want to start this because a dear friend of mines suffered at the hands of an abuser. it wasn't specifically a cult but her family members knew but didn't do anything about it. there was a ""it is what it is"" attitude about it. and the abuser was protected by the rest of the family. they said ""he's just like that sometimes"". and ""she'll be fine"" or ""she probably won't remember it"". now in spite of the very serious core of this potential cult I want there to be a much lighter aspect to it. A sense of community of course. Im a huge foodie so going out to eat or maybe BBQ's could be a thing. or maybe Netflix watch parties. nothing mandatory everything that members do has to be willing done. and no ""disowning"" or ridiculing because they don't want to do something IE punch nazi's. but I want imputes from the community pros , cons, advice or thoughts let me know what you guys think or if you're interested. thanks in advance!"

cults,ihejm9,How to take down a cult?,"Hello friends, 

Most of my extended family is in a (church) cult in East Peoria, IL, that started in the 70’s, called Victorious Life Evangelical Bible Church. This cult involves a 94 year old women as their leader who is in a relationship with a man 25 years younger than her, who listens to her every whim and carries them out. They marry off minors to each other through arranged marriages and crossing state lines, and hold their members under the iron grip of religious manipulation and psychological abuse. This is not all they do, the depth of the horrible things they do to people and families is too much for one post. I am 22 years old and have watched it rip my family apart. A reporter has recently discovered the church and I am working extremely hard to round up witnesses, make people understand how important this is, and get in contact with agencies who can help. Any advice?"

cults,ihdix7,I was a member of a Mormon Fundamentalist Polygamist Cult.,"It was a place in Independence, MO, which is considered a holy place that appears a lot in Mormon history. The leader (who's name I'm not going to disclose for fear of retribution) is intelligent and entrepreneurial. He leads 8+ small businesses, with the intent of changing the world, and gets free labor from those who follow him. They act in the capacity of “students” of his unaccredited  college.

He believes he is Christ, the One Mighty and Strong, though, according to the people there, that is something that you need to have revealed to you (though they will hint at it constantly). He likes people to call him 'Father' He claims Joseph Smith came to him reborn as a man, and revealed his identity to him. (he recounts this with tears regularly).

When I was out there, there were around 150 members, most were plural wives and kids of the leader.  He had about a dozen wives when I left.

He is very charismatic, but he can be mentally and physically abusive, and will punish followers who don’t follow 'the Spirit' by his estimation. His punishments are mostly slapping and yelling, but can be pretty severe. One punishment is to adopt wives from men in the group who he deems unworthy raise a family. Because his followers believe that he is Christ reborn, they will take whatever he dishes out, and even welcome the punishment, because the alternative is to be 'cast off' forever. The few who have left, leave behind spouses and children with no hope of ever being re-united, because their loved ones still believe in Zion, and the prophet will convince them that their family is under the influence of Satan, and 'Father' is protecting them from evil.

I’m sorry that this sounds so negative, There really are many positive aspects of his group. But they are eclipsed by the manipulation and abuse. I think that he genuinely believes what he teaches, even that his punishments are meted out by the Spirit’s Righteous Anger. It would be potentially safe to visit his underground facility in Independence, or any of his business facilities. Just don’t get drawn in by the positive vibes that everyone there has. They really are pure and wholesome people, it’s tragic that they are used like this."

cults,ihaqeb,Cult disguised as a church?,"I believe my aunt and uncle are in a cult disguised as a church. They started attending this ""church"" back in the 90s. My uncle was a violent drug fuled maniac who would make my aunt's life a living hell. Apperantly some one from the church reached out to them and offered help. After attending the church for some time my uncle managed to turn his life around. He stopped the drugs and alcohol and started his own business.

My aunt and uncle  began to invite us to the church every sunday. Since my family was Catholic we didn't show much interest. Eventually they convinced us and we went. The church was packed and it seemed like all the devotees considered the pastor or leader as a holy man who had the power to achieve miracles. I remember him praying really hard over an old lady who was in a wheel chair. He then told her to stand up and walk. Apperantly he had the power to restore people's ability to walk. He then started passing out this type of oil that he claimed was able to relieve any pain in seconds . The service ended with a 45 minute prayer and we went home feeling a little weirded out. It was definitely different than a Catholic service.

We didn't go back for quite some time. We were again invited but this it was for a Friday service. My aunt made it clear that I should come along because it was going to teach my teenage mind a lesson. My mom thought it was a good idea since I was a teenager who was begining to rebel. We went to the church but this time only about 30 or so people showed up. I tought this was a little weird. The pastor then showed up and stated that he was going to begin the prayer that was going to conjure any demons that resided with in us. He started praying really loud and hard and about 5 or 6 people started convulsing and growling. I was freaked out. The ushers then went to each of the affected people and walked them to the front of the congregation. The pastor then ordered the ""demons"" to get on their knees with their hands behind their backs. It honestly look like they were going to be executed. He then placed one of his hands on each one of their heads and began yelling and commanding these demons to leave and never come back. The demonic people would growl and gag. Eventually the so called demons would leave and the people would praise the pastor for saving them. 
 
That service was a little too much for us and we didn't return again for a really long time. We were invited again for another ceremony and they had changed pastors. This new pastor was all about the money. He constantly asked for donations. The interesting part was that he would start at a high quantity and work his way to one dollar. He would say "" who among you has such great faith that they would like donate 500 dollars? please come up..... Anyone want to donate 400....300...200...100...50....20...10....5.....1"".
People would actually donate large sums of money. My uncle being one of those people. Through his business he donated thousands. Apperantly doing so would allow you to ""rank up"".

My uncle and aunt still attend the church. The church has a new leader apperantly. This one claims that it is okay to partake in the drinking of alcohol as long as you are not the one who buys it. How convenient right? 
I found this out on the day of his son's wedding. He had been sober for years. I wanna say at least 20. On the day of the wedding he kept nagging me to go get him a drink. I naturally thought he was joking but realized that his daughters kept giving him beer. So I bought him a bottle of wine and watched him throw 20 years out the window.

I think this ""church"" originates from Brazil or Portugal.
It used to be called ""Pare de sufrir"". This means stop your suffering"" in Spanish. They also have a logo that consists of a red heart and a dove in the middle. That's what I remember. They may have changed it. Anyways thanks for reading."

cults,ih5fyg,Growing up in the Hare Krishna high demand group.,"Good day everyone. As the title implies, I grew up in a Hare Krishna high-demand group. Spent most of my life with in the group now. It isn’t the big main ISKCON group, but a splinter group. Been struggling to move on since it is a big hole in my life. I won’t be going into specifics since I have some modest contact with people I still care about. 

I am happy to field any questions you have about the experience of growing up in a Hindu adjacent cult. Or if you are interested, some of the colourful beliefs they held and taught. 

As for me, a little detail to add context:

-	I spent a large part of my childhood in the group, well into adulthood. 
-	I did not go to any school as a child, rather we had a form of Krishna conscious home schooling (IMO didn’t amount to much). 
-	Raised vegetarian although it was more leaning towards vegan since eggs were banned. 
-	Learned to distrust the bad Karmies (Karma, actions in the world cause good or bad Karma. Karmies are people that engage in Karamic activities. Krishna consciousness is meant to break the cycle of Karma). 
-	I struggle constantly existential dread (I was taught that it was a once in a billion year chance to chant Krishna’s name else we would burn in the material world for countless lifetimes).
-	Avoided an arranged marriage. 
-	No television, music, or movies as a child.
-	Raised to be extremely misogynistic and homophobic."

cults,ig2aio,Past Member of Happy Science,"Have you or anyone you know been a past member of Happy Science? I'm curious to know what the expirence was like. From the little I've looked, I can't find any serious crimes/misconduct done by them. Though I have a feeling they may be as dangerous and manipulative as the Unification Church. But then again, I've looked only a little into them and don't know much."
cults,ifxrez,I need advice from people who have left cults young,"I am 18 and have made a friend (16) who's family were Mormons up until he was about 11 and then they decided that ""wasn't good enough"" and started to take things into their own hands. They are very strict about the bible and the sabbath. They believe the world is going to end soon and are stocking up on food and watch videos on how to be ""ready"" for it and what hell is like. My friend is not explicitly discouraged not to express his more eccentric side but is manipulated into not doing it by his mother. On top of this his mother doesn't really want him to be independent, for example, he can't pack his own lunch for school or even pick out his own clothes and whenever he tries to bring up that he'd like to he more independent his mother just kind of ignores it. 

He's made it clear to them and me that he doesn't want anything to do with this cult but since everyone in his immediate family is involved in it he's being forced to stay a part of it until he out of the house. It gets in the way of almost every part of his life and he's even admitted to me that he's wanted to kill himself because of how these ""tutorials"" (that's what his family calls them) make him feel. 

I've watched some of the videos he was forced to watch and it definitely gives me the sense that they're trying to brainwash him.

Even though his father has said he can leave when he's old enough, I have a feeling his family is going to try to discourage and maybe even prevent that as much as possible. How can I help him stay sane until he can legally leave?"

ouijadocumentation.wordpress.com"
cults,ifvimz,Was This a Church or a Cult? My personal story of leaving a church that turned abusive. I think it may have turned into a cult. Or was it always a cult?,
cults,ifoiap,"Evangelical cult leaders gonna cult leader, I suppose. The fact that we're still dealing with the plague of Jim Bakker after all these decades of fraud, jail time, and grifting is pretty amazing.",
cults,ifoa43,Is this a cult?,"I will try to keep this as short as possible, but I will try to give as many details as I possibly can in regards to my suspicion that this is an actual cult. I will not disclose the countries or any other information because I don't want this to go into a different direction than its purpose and I also don't want to make the cause more known that it already is cause it's not worth it.

There is this woman who married a foreigner and had her kids taken away by the authorities in her ex-husband's country after their divorce because she was being abusive and she kept threatening that she would kidnap the kids and flee to her original country. The kids have their dad's nationality citizenship so CPS was not happy with the mentally unstable mother.

From that moment, she started this campaign to take her kids back, but all of her pleas have been rejected by all possible means. She was also convicted twice, once for physically attacking social workers and the other one for slander. So she is a handful.

The problem is very simple, she had her parenting rights taken away cause she is unfit to be a mother until she accepts to treat her mental illness and revise her behavior, but instead she turned her life into a social media circus, slandering the country where she still lives in, doxxing social workers and authorities (releasing personal information of people who are in charge of her case) and terrorizing the authorities. She also is not allowed to work anymore, so she is living off donations from the idiots who regard her as their Messiah. And here comes the culty part:

Crazy lady has amassed a handful of people who believe everything that she says. And I mean EVERYTHING. People believe that in one of the most civilized European countries, kids are being kept in ""cages"", starved to death and beaten up by the CPS. People believe that in said country, there are cannibal restaurants and that children are being taught in school to have sex with immigrants. All of this because she said so, no other proof. People believe absolutely any illogical thing she dares to write with her stupid hands on her stupid Facebook. **Which leads me to one of the cult signs: people will believe anything the cult leader says, without question. Those who dare to question her will be shunned, threatened and insulted.**

She presents herself as being extremely religious, fanatic even, and 80% of what she says is related to churches, God and priests. Her followers often speak of her as a ""martyr Saint"" which leads me to another cult sign: **Cult leader has some sort of connection with the divinity, or so they say.** She even had the audacity to say that her car broken down completely, but she prayed reaaaally hard and the car magically started and they made it safely to their destination. And people. Bought. It. Which takes me to my next cult sign, asking for donations. The car story had not only the purpose of showing people how much of a holy being she is, but also asking for donations to fix her magic flying car. She has several donation campaigns going on and often asks for money, and her followers happily give her whatever they can even though most of them are already poor. **Cult leaders often ask for donations as far as I am concerned.**

She says that she is a doctor and makes all of these ridiculous ""studies"" which have nothing to do with any medical knowledge, telling people to treat illnesses with garlic and that viruses don't exist. She also tells people that they can either believe in viruses or in God. And they buy her shit, and then shun those who say she is insane, because she is a ""docthurrr"". **Cult leaders often hold a position of power or some higher knowledge, and their ideas are often against the norm, it's the ""truth"".** Correct me if I'm wrong.

The thing that really concerns me is that now she told her followers to harass the authorities in her city, in her children's name. I'm not even sure that is legal or not, but besides the fact that those poor kids would want no part in this, she has no right to speak or do anything in their name, this seems to me that it's just the start. If her followers actually go on with the harassment plan, this will be her sign that she can ask them to do ANYTHING and they will happily comply. There is just one little step away from her asking them to perform terrorist attacks or just hurt people. That being paired with her constant doxxing, is very very dangerous.

No one takes her seriously, everyone just laughs at her and call her insane but no one is thinking about the handful of brainwashed idiots who are ready to do anything in her name. Any thoughts on this? This definitely looks like a cult to me and a potentially dangerous one too!"

cults,iew0eh,What would you do?,"I need advice and Reddit is the only safe place to turn. I'll try to keep it brief, but I also need to elaborate in order for people to understand and offer me sound advice.

There is a ""church"" in my city that is without a doubt, a cult. I've spoken with cult experts and sociologists, as well as read lots of literature and books on the subject all have confirmed or lead me to that conclusion.   


At this point, the biggest issue is that the pastor and his wife have a very callous attitude towards the pandemic and are spreading conspiracy theories on Facebook. I am aware of the fact that this speech is protected, I don't like it, but it is. However, considering the undue influence these people have over their followers (they control relationships, what is watched/listened to, where to eat, what is allowed to be eaten, etc.), this has potential to result in a MAJOR outbreak in our city (small town Ontario, Canada).   


Aside from the Covid problems, there are major spiritual, psychological, and emotional abuses taking place. Many ex-members come out fearing hell, eternal damnation, or that they will be struck by lightening after leaving. The group of us that are investigating this church also believe that there is misappropriation of funds taking place, money scams, and that they are illegally obtaining IP addresses to identify those speaking out against them on reddit anonymously ([https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/hrwfy8/third\_day\_worship\_center/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/hrwfy8/third_day_worship_center/)). Anyone who speaks out publicly about what they suffered are subpoenaed. Three within the last few weeks have been served using their personal Facebook accounts to callout the pastor.   


These people have a lot of money, they are using the bible to manipulate and control people, and they do not care about public health and safety during the pandemic. When anyone tries to warn the city, they are served. I have contacted local politicians who told me to go to journalists. I have contacted The Fifth Estate, W5, one local news source, and nothing.

There must be something that can be done? At least regarding the Covid situation. Local citizens should NOT have to investigate a problematic group because the law is part of the group in question. Oh and I forgot to mention...THE MAYOR ALSO ATTENDS!

While shopping at target with my gf, a couple starts chatting us up. Very quickly they move from small talk about the coffee we were buying to what we studied in school and planed to do for a career. The man basically did all the talking and his gf seemed very timid. He told us they recently moved from the Midwest to Denver and had a really hard time finding jobs until they met a couple who taught them how to be financially independent in their 30’s. My Gf like any reasonable person began asking questions. They dodged her questions and the man gave me his contact info if I was interested to meet and talk about it. 

Me and my gf both thought something was off about the situation. I was curious though so I decided to set up a meeting with him and his wife at the same shopping center a couple days later. They tell me the couple training them is only interested in me and they don’t want my gf to come, red flag I know. So I go to meet with them at the same target. After starting off with some small talk the man ask me what I would commit to gain complete financial freedom and what I would do if I obtained that. He then asked me how committed I would be to obtain this. Naturally I replied I would need to know more info before making that decision. They very quickly then rescinded their offer and said they were looking for a different fit. I left and forgot about it till I read an article about cults today. Was I targeted by a cult? An interested thing to note is my gf encountered the mans wife in the shampoo isle and they made small talk before approaching us in the coffee isle."
cults,id29ce,Any more info. World Mission Church of God,"A few months back I was walking around a mall a younger dude approached me. He asked me if I wanted to go to his bible study. I am a Christian and have been in a few bible studies so seemed pretty normal, but I live about 90 minutes from this city so I was obviously not going to go .  He started asking me questions about what I knew about the Bible and the Trinity and some mainline Christian beliefs. Then he asked what Gender I thought God was which I thought was a little odd, and I thought of it’s probably a more progressive church and they are gonna talk about some LGBTQ stuff. Then he started saying stuff about God the Mother and I just listened and tried to be polite. So anyways he asks if I want to come to this bible study again and i say I can’t because I live 90 minutes away, and before I walked away I asked which church he was with and he says “World Mission Church of God”. I went back to this mall a few weeks later and another dude comes up and ask me if I want to come to his bible study and I told him I had been asked by another guy a couple weeks ago about the same thing. 

So I’ve looked into it and it seems pretty crazy. Like there is a South Korean lady that is Mother God. There doesn’t seem to be a lot more info on the group that I can find. Does anyone have anymore experience or knowledge?"

For example, I know that Jehovah's Witnesses have an r/exjw page. From this page I can go and gather resources from survivors on where to get support upon leaving the movement/being a cult survivor. 

If you know of any websites or subreddits dedicated to cult survivors specifically, please let me know. I will post this around as many subreddits to get this started.

cults,ic0i08,Can you intervene before a cult becomes fully formed?,"I have a friend who started with the general conspiracies (Bill Gates is a demon, masks are the gov controlling, etc) but has rapidly transitioned into a full blown advocate for these things. I had to back away from our friendship because it really just became her constantly sending articles to fit her agenda, we're talking dozens a day. There is no other conversation, just her trying to convince people of these things .

Fast forward a few months and she sends me a link to her friend's ""mental health organization"" suddenly it all made sense. She has come into contact with a guy who also believes these things so she has converted herself to fully following his words and wisdoms. She even has a ""funemployed"" role in his organization now.

The website itself is just a bunch of nonsense and big words to sucker people into donating money to him. The organization in no way advocates for mental health or provides real services. They simply are looking to spread their truth by travelling across the country and trying to convert people. 

I know this is not a full blown cult or anything, but it has all the makings. This guy has recruited and manipulated multiple women and even some children into believing he is a mental health professional who can help them better themselves. Their goals are to raise money to fund their cross country, drug fueled, adventure. She won't even talk to me anymore without running things by him to form an appropriate response to my questions. It's confusing because somehow all the conspiracies fit into their values, even though many aren't even related to mental health. 

Basically my friends and I are at a loss here, we know she's being brainwashed by this guy. We also know she is trying to recruit others to follow their mission. It's scary to watch happen and I worry for her well being. As a mother, I also worry for the young impressionable minds they are reaching as well. 

I tried to use a fake Facebook to message him directly to see how he lures people in, but he never responded. 

Where do I go from here? How do I intervene? Or do I just have to let this run its course? 

Tl;dr friend has been brainwashed by some guy who is recruiting women and children to spread his ""truth"" and to raise funds for him.

cults,ibtjms,I got drugged and branded by a cult,"So it’s mid August in semi rural England and I’m meeting a few mates from an old school. I’m 14, white, average weight. We got pissed on grey goose and coke I nicked from me dad and invited a bunch of people of which I only knew a few. The oldest guy there was quite shady looking, if not expensively clothed with Armani shirt and jeans and yeezys and a oversized hoodie he wore more like a cloak, and I asked him to go buy us some more drinks because he looked old enough to buy legally and gave him either £10 or £20 I’m not sure. So off he went and we all walked off to a nearby car park where some chavs started a small fire with crisp packets and leaf litter. Anyway this American kid started piping up about how the country’s shit and that he wished we lost ww2 and sparks an argument, and he’s promptly shut down. I then started venting abt all the problems with entitled Americans and how they think rights make them invincible and ridiculous levels of patriotism, when the shady guy comes back with 2 6 packs of Guinness (I now realise that that’s really cheap for £10/£20). By now there’s only like 15 of us left and half are scared to drink or don’t want to for unknown reasons. Anyway when he came back he kinda disappeared, I’m not sure he might just have stopped talking. At some point the American kid stated a fight and pulled a knife so we all kicked the shit out of him after persuading him to chill out. He ran off, I think he broke a rib or something. Me and the mate I originally went out to meet chased him for a bit, then came back. By this point it was late, like 11pm, but being British and all we can’t settle for just being drunk. I drank another two cans over the next half hour and then sat down on a bench away from the group, next to a co-op crematorium with the original mate. Let’s call him billy. Anyway he dared me to go inside and that’s all I remember from there on. I woke up back on the bench twenty minutes later and Billy’s being sick in a bush while two Irish sounding kids took the piss out of him. I remember getting rowdy and trying to start a fight but they backed off laughing. This pissed me off more but I went back to the now smouldering fire. the shady kid offered me a opened but not drunk guiness and I take it, spilling a lot but drinking most of the rest. Anyway the guy asks me about my opinion on foreigners and immigrants and I say I don’t like Americans and french and that’s it, and he laughs at me. The two Irish kids come back helping billy walk between them and they all sit down. At this point I can’t remember the time. I do remember staring at the moon through a weird church spire decoration thing while they bragged about beating up this Muslim kid whose dad owned a corner shop we frequented. I asked them why they didn’t like Muslims and they asked why I didn’t like french people. That’s the last thing I recall before being in someone’s back garden around yet another fire, and the taller Irish kids poking it with a stick. I notice Billy’s gone. They ask me if i want to jump people for them for money and I agree (I was very drunk and probably spiked at this point, would never do this while sober) and they said to lie down. I laid down on a pallet crate thing next to a shed and I remember waking up and my left forearm searing with pain. The stick they’d been poking the fire with was a fucking brand. I looked at the burn and kinda dozed off in shock, I don’t know how to put it. It’s like a crescent moon with a triangle obtrusion and a diagonal line through it, and I’ve got it bandaged up now because I don’t want it to scar, but I know it’s probably gonna. I got up and tried to fight them but I was dizzy and nauseous and can’t really remember what happened from there on. I woke up behind a grey bin in the back garden at 2 the next day and walked home where I got promptly harassed by my dad and questioned about my arm, I told him I couldn’t remember. Turns out billy left when his mum called to get him home. There’s probably a moral to this somewhere but I can’t be arsed to find it. Have a good day"

I highly recommend journaling about your past cult experiences to better understand what happened to you.  I've had so many insights as I've worked through my writing. I have the computer read back what I've written, and hearing it in someone else's voice sounds absolutely crazy.  I can't even beleive some of it was my life.

I was called a prophet in some circles... which sounds insane when I say it out loud.  After 10+ years, the law had to protect my family when we left.  We were controlled by fear. Bad was called good and good was called bad.  

I'm happy to answer questions if you have any.  I lost a lot of my life there, but maybe I can use that to help someone else.

I have begun searching more about it and I’m seeing that others who have family members that are apart of that group have had similar experiences as me. My parents are not the same since joining, they’re not the parents I once had(and this isn’t a good thing). They have disassociated from family members including myself and my sibling despite us being as supportive as possible without being interested in joining.

cults,ibpsh9,Free ebook excerpt,"I am working hard revising my first free ebook and thought the following excerpt would be good to share: 

   At the time Mary spoke about the fourth dimension as being called Bliss, I had already known, for a while, about the fourth dimension, because, I had asked, Mary, some questions, about what happens, shortly after you die, and she answered, by simply writing, “4D.”  For your interest, when conversing with Mary about the fourth dimension, I was told, that, we have a life review, and it is experienced, in the fourth dimension.  Amazingly, Mary was the one who had brought up life review, not me.  I consider that to be profound, because, before Mary spelled that out for me, I had heard of life review before, from other Earthly third dimensional sources, like psychics and mediums.  So, for me to see Mary write the words, life review, affirmed my faith.  In this life, you rarely really know if someone who talks about spirituality is talking bullshit or not.  So it was great to feel that those sources who I had heard talk about life review, weren't being bullshitters.  Anyway, extremely interestingly, I also learned of something, with regards to the fourth dimension, that I had never heard a psychic nor a medium talk about.  That is, that, we also, experience something, called, core journey, there too; the fourth dimension has both a life review, and a core journey, in it.  So what is a core you ask?  Well, at the time of learning about the core journey, I had already known what a, core, was, because months earlier, I had asked Mary a question, about how she always came to talk to me, whenever I was using the Ouija board with my Ouija board partner, and I would recite the words, “Mary, are you here?”  Mary answered to me, that, there are bundles of threads, which are connected from her core, to mine, and it is through that connection, that she can hear me call her to the Ouija board sessions.  Not knowing what a core was, I asked her [what a core is], and she answered, that it is the soul’s brain.  So then I asked her how the bundles got there, and she answered that leaders put them there.  So, to reiterate this portion of my book: Mary told me, that leaders made thread bundles, and then they connected them from Mary's soul’s brain to my soul’s brain, and, in the fourth dimension, human beings' soul's brains, go on a journeys of sorts; that is called the core journey.

cults,ib87ou,I was in a cult.,"Two cults actually. I was born into the Mormon church. Baptized at the age of 7 by my father. I remember all of the Sunday school songs and teachings. The “missionaries” still find me now, 20 years later, which is scary. When I was 8, my family moved out of state to a place where the nearest Mormon church was two hours away. So we stopped going. A year later, my mom found a church close by that she loved going to. So she brought all four of us kids. It was an apostolic Pentecostal church. I was freaked out at first, but I was only 9 and had no choice in going. Soon, my dad followed and we were all in the church. I couldn’t cut my hair, wear makeup, I had to wear skirts below my knees only, sleeves to my elbows, no jewelry, no tv or secular music, no internet on my phone, and no friends outside of the church. I went on mission trips to save people from other countries. I was at church every day of the week for prayer or a service. I worked for the church for less than minimum wage. My pastor had set me up on multiple dates because I was expected to be married by 20. I was in this cult for 16 years. When I left, my dad was the only one still in and he disowned me. He told me my siblings had pulled me out and they had the devil inside of them telling them to steal my soul from god. I experienced mental, physical, and sexual abuse during those 16 years. I have only been out for two years. I still struggle with having to unlearn everything I was brainwashed into thinking. I don’t believe in god anymore, but I still have that nagging feeling that I’m going to hell because that is what I was always told. 

But. At least I am out. I have never been happier and I’m glad I was able to get out."
cults,ib57tv,I think the landlords for the old lot my job was at were in an extreme religion?,"I'm not sure if this is entirely a cult, but it's kinda sketch.

So I work for a store that sells a variety of kooky items.  We're in a major Southern city.  Recently our boss announced a surprise relocation (and then COVID hit. perfect timing) so we're moving from the lot we previously had.  The people that owned the lot we were originally at were patriarchs of a rich and powerful family in the city.  They have a number of small businesses across the metroplex, including a store next to us where they sold various things, mainly furniture.  Most of everything else they sold was religious garb: Bibles, devotionals, Christian children's book, crosses to hang in the house, and Christian decorations.  Nothing out of the ordinary for the Bible Belt.

The kinda sketch part is when I learned about the mandates they had for what products we could sell.  They were fine with items mocking Christianity (not in a malicious way), they were fine with items that had vulgarity on it, they were fine with things involving magic like Harry Potter, but they said we couldn't sell ANYTHING with snakes or octopi/squids.  No one can wear anything with snakes or octopi.  If someone has a tattoo with a snake or octopi on it, they would have to cover it up.  We were told it was due to their religion.  We're not allowed to ask any more than that.  We're not allowed to bring it up to customers.  They even told our manager to not tell it the employees, but he ditched that idea because we constantly have people asking if we have rubber snakes and the employees don't have an answer for why we don't have ANYTHING snakes.

Now I can understand not allowing snakes, because of the serpent in the garden of Eden, but I found literally nothing about octopi in the Bible or in anything else.  Does anyone have any idea of this?"

In case you didn't know, in recovery circles, saying anything remotely against AA is grounds for the firing range. You're told you're gonna use again. Or you have bad sobriety. A doorknob can be your higher power. Yes I'm serious.

cults,ianipj,The cult-like following of Morning Star Ministries from a local perspective,"Ive now lived in Fort Mill, SC for going on five years, living within a three minute walking distance from the now abandoned PTL Club now known as Morning Star Ministries. The PTL (Praise the Lord) Club was formerly owned by Jim Tammy Faye Bakker television ""evangelicals"". The Bakkers ended up opening Heritage USA in 1978, a Christian themed amusement park that was at one point the third-largest amusement park in the country. The park was only open for 11 years due to Jim Bakker being exposed for tax fraud, sexual involvement with a church secretary, and Hurricane Hugo damages. Currently there isn't much left of the amusement park, my neighborhood was built on-top of the old waterpark and the rest has been taken out and turned into other surrounding neighborhoods. It has become a sad sight to see over the years to be honest, most of the residents are older people who gave all their money to the Bakkers and now have to seek assistance at a local care center in many cases. I frequently walk around what is still left of Heritage USA,now only the ministry and Heritage Grand Hotel are left standing (the hotel is a whole other problem, the church doesn't have enough money to renovate it and the county doesn't have enough money or resources I'm assuming to tear it down). I truly don't think there was as much of a cult-like following at the church until Rick Joyner, right-wing televangelist took over. Since being taken over by Joyner, its seemed to gotten even more grim than before, he's undoubtedly an extreme right-wing conservative with some interesting beliefs. From my short amount of research on him, Ive gathered that he believes:

*  People who oppose Donald Trump are being led by Satan.
* That conservatives are under attack and that Christians must create militias for the ""coming Civil War.""
* That the US and South Korea have the lowest number of Covid-19 cases (that not being true even when he stated this in March) because they pray more than everyone else. 
* That all the disciples that Jesus chose were ""Donald Trumps."" 
* Claims that he thinks he had Ebola and the Bird Flu and had an eight hour visit to heaven after he fell asleep. 
* That God visited his church through a cloud and made it rain inside the building. 
* Claims he interpreted ""Prophetic Revelation"" for national law-enforcement following 9/11. 

This isn't even close to a dent on all the facebook videos full of ridiculous claims the televangelist has made over the years. As far as his church, he claims to have had guest preacher Todd Bentley at his church who performed hundreds of  ""verified resurrections"" and healed permanently disabled people. If it isn't obvious enough, Joyner is a professional con-man who wants these followers of Bakkers to stay active within his ministry. The ministry seems to have a theme of teaching others how to prophesize (speak to God) and that were currently in the ""End Times"",  which in my opinion is seems like a great way to manipulate people into believing in the ""Power of God"". Coming from someone who grew up in a somewhat Christian household, even my parents and almost everyone I know agrees that Morning Star Ministries isn't just a ""normal church"", theres just a certain energy thats inside and around that place that doesn't seem to sit right with anyone. Do I think he's running a full on cliche cult? No. I think that Rick Joyner has manipulated his followers into believing any word he says and that there is definitely something weird going on behind closed doors in his ministry. This isn't an attack against the christian community as a whole, Im just curious as to the mindset of christians who believe con-men pastors like him. I hope this gave some people a little insight onto what Heritage USA has become and how not all Christianity can be good Christianity."

cults,i9jfli,The International Order of Rainbiw for Girls is a cult?,"I'd like to say some things about my time in rainbow. I was in about 6th grade when I was recruited to join rainbow by a friend. Her mother was a ex rainbow girl and she was putting her kids into it. Her daughter was in rainbow and her son was in demolay. They required you to be the age of 11 to join. It was very suspicious, when you would ask them questions about their group, they would give you half answers. They would say ""we get to do fun things, we do community service, charity events."" I thought it was a cult at first and I never really got proved wrong either.... We'll get to that. After you join you have to go through a couple hour long initiation. I don't remember how long it was, maybe 3 hours? They would say things like ""with this vow do you accept..."" They would take you around to different podiums they called stations. These stations had different things on them. They had a couple gabbles, ""a pot of gold"", ribbons, ect.. I don't really remember the initiation all that well, as I was young at the time, but they would kind of say things like you would hear in some sort of satanic ritual, it sounded kind of satanic...but I didn't really pay attention to it because at the time I needed something in my life sort of like a family, and rainbow gave me that. I didn't have a very good upbringing and rainbow was my escape from my abusive household. After you were initiated you would go to meetings. They always told me my parents could come to the meetings but they never actually let them. When I asked them they said ""what we do here is sacred and shouldn't be mentioned to outsiders."" So we would start meetings by putting the podiums out and setting the stations and the flag up. We would wear these necklaces with different symbols on them. We would have to wear these wedding dresses, ball gowns, prom dresses, but they all had to be pastel colors. No dark colors, not even in makeup. We always had to have our hair up if it was above shoulder length. We'd put our hair in buns and other updos. I remember some of the stations, faith, drill leader, love, hope, ect... We would memorize lines to say during these meetings from a ritual book. If we didn't memorize these lines we were looked down upon, if we messed up a line while saying it we were looked down upon, sometimes scolded, nothing psychical though. We would have certain paths in the alter room we had to walk. There would be an opportunity to donate money to the charity they were doing, i think faith was the one who would come around with the basket to put the money in. If you did not donate money they looked down upon you. As my family was very poor every penny we got counted towards, rent, food, bills. We would hold hands and sing in a circle in the middle of the room around an alter table that had a type of ""bible""/ritual book on it. It wasn't a regular bible, and they certainly weren't praising the god or Jesus commonly known throughout the world. At the end of every meeting we would do this type of prayer thing where we would vow to not tell our secrets that happen in rainbow to the outside world. After the meetings we would have snacks or food in the dining area of the lodge. We would talk about upcoming events and the next meetings. I remember this one meeting where the Freemasons came. I'm not sure what type of event it was but all the rainbow girls were freaking out. It was like they were ""devoted to the men"". Like in the 1960's housewife type of way. We had to cook for the freemasons and prepare and serve food. I think there were some demolay there to. After we served them they made a speech. I'm not sure exactly what the speech was about, as I don't remember it, but they were all laughing and having a good time it seemed. I remember quite a few Freemasons looking at the younger girls (underage girls) quite often. They would stare at them like predators to pray. Allegedly. They would sometimes ask them questions like "" how are you today"" and ""what are your plans for the week, anything fun"". They were very creepy but nobody seemed to notice. There were other meetings and events where the freemasons would do this too. They would just stare at younger underaged girls. They also treated the women in a way like I was mentioning earlier, they would treat them like they didn't have a lot of rights and they could do as they pleased with them. ALLEGEDLY. I don't want to be sued. This is all alleged thank you. They would have multiple hour long events. There was an event that lasted 5 hours once. It was terrible. Every summer we would go to a college for 4 days. We'd have to pay a lot of money just to go there for 4 days. Since I was poor some of the other moms offered to pay for me and I let them. They would also look down on me and talk bad about me because I was poor. Most of the rainbow girls were well off family's. They had a fund they'd put money in every now and then to save up for going to the college for l the girls but it was rarely met. This event at the college was called grand assembly I think. The meetings at this college would be split into halfs. One meeting was in the morning and lasted 4 hours. Then we ate lunch. Then went back to the meeting for another 4 hours. In these meetings a new girl would be promoted as head of rainbow. I'm not exactly sure what she did. I think she oversees everything, like events, meetings, ect. There would be themes for every year for grand assembly. We would all make props, dress up, compete in contests. It was ""fun"". They also had dances sometimes. These dances were usually also themed. I forgot to mention, all the rainbow girls have lots of dresses, they would all lend them to each other because not all of them could afford thousands and thousands of dollars worth of wedding dresses even though they were well off. They would even give some of the dresses away to the poorer rainbow girls sometimes. Ok back to grand assembly. One year I didn't feel like going to grand assembly for many reasons. The rainbow mom's started treating me bad there because I was poor and couldn't pay for most events they would go to so they would always pay for me. Mind you I never asked them to. They did this of their own free will without asking or telling me. I didn't even know these events costed money until one of my friends in rainbow told me. The only thing I knew costed money is when we would go to the college for grand assembly. Mind you, I didn't ask them to pay for that either, nor did they ask me. They didn't tell me until after they played either, for grand. So I didn't want to ho because they were all talking bad about me behind my back. Imagine women all in their 40s talking bad about you because you are poor and they think you are using them for money even though you were not aware of events costing money because nobody ever made you aware of this, and also them paying for you of their own free will. How does someone talk bad about a 12 year old just because she is poor? I will never understand that. So I didn't want to go and spend 4 days with them at grand. So I told them I wasn't going. They called frequently to try to get me to go, saying they had finally raised enough money for everyone to go and that if I didn't go then I would be a bad person because that money could have gone to someone else. But since they raised enough money for everyone in the group to go, how would I have been a bad person since if I didn't go, it would be extra money in their pockets? They raised enough money for everyone, so if I didn't go it wouldn't matter because everyone else still has enough to go...see they would try to use manipulation tactics, they said I could be kicked out of the group if I didn't go since they had money for me to go. So I went dispite all their negative acts towards me. And I didn't have fun, I was miserable. This was around the time I wanted to quit rainbow. Not just because of the moms but because I was slowly realizing that this is probably a cult. They would try to brainwash you with their beliefs, especially when it came to who you were as a person and what you could wear. Mind you I didn't wear anything provocative or anything like that because I was 13 at this point. Even when you aren't wearing the formal dresses they still tell you what to wear, how to act. You had to dress nice, and well, I was poor so I had dollar store clothes. And I'm guessing they didn't like that because they would constantly tell me that I couldn't wear certain things. I had to have formal wear and I didn't, so I just didn't go to any events or meetings that I had to wear formal clothes to. We went to an eastern star once to visit someones family member. I remember it was really nice, or so it appeared to be. When you walked in the place was huge and fancy, I remember they had these big flowers at the front desk and they had these red cloths draped over the top of doors with beautiful tassels. The rugs were a pretty red color too. But the rooms of the people staying there were concerning. Ahem, allegedly, there rooms weren't very well kept. There were things out of place and all over the floors and tables of almost every room I walked my. I thought it seemed strange that it was like this because surely, everyone is not a pig. We met with an old guy there and sat in the dining hall. I think this was an nursing home specifically for the Freemasons or rainbow girls, demolay, jobsdaughters? But im not sure. Please tell me more about eastern star in the comments. I know sometimes they'd have meetings there and it was a big place so maybe it was a nursing home and a meeting place? This guy looked worn out and tired, I didn't think anything of it yet because he was old and old people have problems such as illness and pains. He was telling a story of how he went to get a present from his car for his wife because it was Christmas and he fell on the snow and was just laying there until somebody found him and called the ambulance. That's how he ended up here? After we were all done talking to him an nurse came to take him back to his room and we were all leaving but I told them to wait for me because I wanted to use the bathroom. I came out of the bathroom a minute later and I heard this nurse yelling at the patient. She was saying ""fuck you, don't tell me what I should do"" And the patient lady was saying ""please give me my medicine I need to take my medicine"" and the nurse said ""not until you learn manners"" and the nurse walked out of the room. I went to go see what the took looked like and it looked messy like all the others. There was this red curtain. The kind you'd see in hospitals. It was blocking me from seeing the bed and who was in it. I left back to the group and asked one of the girls if she had heard the lady screaming. She told me no. They must have been to far away to hear. My guess is that the staff were ALLEGEDLY abusing the patients and people there, but I'm not for sure. Why else would the rooms be like that and the lady screaming. I think they were ALLEGEDLY mistreating the patients. That was really what set me off to quit. Something more was going on here and I'm not sure what. After I quit I heard that someone in one of the groups got ALLEGEDLY raped by a couples of the Freemasons. I've never heard anything about that since. If someone could explain exactly why this is a cult I would really appreciate it. If you read their books and hear the things they say you'd know it was a cult, but since when I left I had to give the ritual book that I had back to them, I have no proof. I also don't remember a lot of things they said because I purposely chose to block it out because they were somewhat horrific things they did and said and taught. They were very controlling in a demeaning way. I didn't want to remember, it scared me too much, and now I don't remember when I want to...If you hear about these groups recruiting please warn people not to join them."

On the morning of April 20, 2006, when U.S. President Bush was carrying out a major state event on the South Lawn of the White House, the ""Epoch Times"" reporter Wang Wenyi who had mixed into the reporters shouted cult slogans and created a ""lion roar"" incident.

""Epoch Times"" reporter Wang Wenyi makes trouble

　 It is precisely because of Wang Wenyi's sabotage and disturbance that the governments, security departments and media of various countries have experienced the extremeness and madness of the ""Epoch Times"" and other ""Falungong"" media, ""reporters"" and the ""Falungong"" organizations behind it.

　　——The ""congratulatory letter"" of the big smile. On March 8, 2011, a piece of ""explosive news"" appeared on the ""Epoch Times"" website-""The French President Wishes Shen Yun's Performance in Paris a Complete Success"", but just 2 hours after the ""news"" was released, It was quietly deleted by ""Epoch Times"". Why is this ""news"" of ""Epoch Times"" so short-lived? It turned out that the problem was that the so-called ""Sarkozy congratulation letter"" was actually a rejection letter.

　　 It is precisely because ""Epoch Times"" often fabricates such false reports as mentioned above, it has been questioned and criticized by many countries and people.

　　 The obscenity and rumors of ""Epoch Times"" are frequently rejected

　　 Since the ""Epoch Times"" of ""Falungong"" has no credibility at all, relevant countries and governments have adopted an attitude of rejecting it.

In June, the request of ""Epoch Times"" to participate in the Markham City Carnival was once blocked by the organizer. Rejected; in August of the same year, another Richmond Hill Summer Carnival organized by the Canadian Chinese Association of York also refused to let ""Epoch Times"" participate in the event.

　　 ""Epoch Times"" spreads the evil idea, obsessively demonizes China, often lie publicly, is notorious, has become the birthplace of rumors and has been exposed and angry by many experts and scholars.

cults,i8xvlg,The ethics of manipulation,"""First published Fri Mar 30, 2018; substantive revision Sun Mar 22, 2020

Consider this case: Tonya plans to do Y, but Irving wants her to do X instead. Irving has tried unsuccessfully to provide Tonya with reasons for doing X rather than Y. If Irving is unwilling to resort to coercion or force, he might deploy any of the following tactics to try to influence Tonya’s choice. For example, Irving might …

Charm Tonya into wanting to please Irving by doing X.

Exaggerate the advantages of doing X and the disadvantages of doing Y, and/or understate the disadvantages of doing X and the advantages of doing Y.

Make Tonya feel guilty for preferring to do Y.

Induce Tonya into an emotional state that makes doing X seem more appropriate than it really is.

Point out that doing Y will make Tonya seem less worthy and appealing to her friends.

Make Tonya feel badly about herself and portray Y as a choice that will confirm or exacerbate this feeling, and/or portray X as a choice that will disconfirm or combat it.

Do a small favor for Tonya before asking her to do X, so that she feels obligated to comply.

Make Tonya doubt her own judgment so that she will rely on Irving’s advice to do X.

Make it clear to Tonya that if she does Y rather than X, Irving will withdraw his friendship, sulk, or become irritable and generally unpleasant.

Focus Tonya’s attention on some aspect of doing Y that Tonya fears and ramp up that fear to get her to change her mind about doing Y.

Each of these tactics could reasonably be called a form of manipulation. Many also have more specific, commonplace names, such as “guilt trip” (tactic 3), “gaslighting” (tactic 8), “peer pressure” (tactic 5), “negging” (tactic 6), and “emotional blackmail” (tactic 9). Perhaps not everyone will agree that every tactic on this list is properly described as manipulation. And in some cases, whether the tactic seems manipulative may depend on various details not specified in the case as described. For example, if Y is seriously immoral, then perhaps it is not manipulative for Irving to induce Tonya to feel guilty about planning to do Y. It is also possible that we might revise our judgments about some of these tactics in light of a fully worked out and well supported theory of manipulation—if we had one. Nevertheless, this list should provide a reasonably good sense of what we mean by “manipulation” in the present context. It should also serve to illustrate the wide variety of tactics commonly described as manipulation.

Manipulation is often characterized as a form of influence that is neither coercion nor rational persuasion. But this characterization immediately raises the question: Is every form of influence that is neither coercion nor rational persuasion a form of manipulation? If manipulation does not occupy the entire logical space of influences that are neither rational persuasion nor coercion, then what distinguishes it from other forms of influence that are neither coercion nor rational persuasion?

The term “manipulation” is commonly thought to include an element of moral disapprobation: To say that Irving manipulated Tonya is commonly taken to be a moral criticism of Irving’s behavior. Is manipulation always immoral? Why is manipulation immoral (when it is immoral)? If manipulation is not always immoral, then what determines when it is immoral?""

I looked into his business and he owns a men only treatment facility in PA. When she told her parents this we each got responses from three different numbers with a link to a different rehab in Texas. My wife has her medical card for migraines and smokes weed, she is a social cig smoker and does not do opiates or any other type of drug. They showed up on Thursday- all 3 older sisters and her parents and the guy with no mask and the intervention guy continuously touched her arm after she asked he stop. He also shouted at her at which point I stepped in telling him to lower his voice and he charged at me. My wife being who she is stepped in front of him thinking it would stop him in his path, instead he started yelling he was calling the police. I asked what for and he said the title was in her dads name. She handed my sister the keys and said he had no reason to take the car, though after reading about it almost wish he did call the police because accepting money from her father for unsolicited recovery services is not legal from what I understand. When she said she did not need help they did not respond but kept reading their scripted letters. The interventionalist also brought up charges for weed that she was granted HYTA for years ago, and told me “her father has invested a lot of money into this company.” I have read about Narconon and the rehab scams in general and am getting so concerned for our well-being and safety. They now shut off her credit hard in her own name- no idea how- and her phone that her dad still had ownership too. With no warning of the car and phone however she is locked out of bank, business, and personal accounts including her media and intellectual music property. We are scared of what they will do next. I believe there is fraudulent and corrupt lead generation going on, as she also kept seeing suboxene ads pushed to her on Instagram and Facebook and could not figure out why before this happened.

cults,i70vgr,Korean Christian Church cult. Anyone else experience anything like this?,"Here’s my back story... I come from a Korean family. My father has been a pastor/reverend most of his life. My mother is also a heavy drinker of the kool aid. My parents often pray in tongues for hours a day, read the Bible everyday, and etc. We’ve always been a part of a Korean church congregation for as long as I can remember. 

We moved around a lot. I think I attended around 8-10 different schools by the time I graduated from high school. Could be more or less. I stopped keeping track a while ago. Our family moved around a lot because my father would always relocate churches. It seemed like we would change churches any time my father wouldn’t get along with the other pastors or the congregation. We would relocate about every 1-2 years. 

My father has a very inflated ego. His sermons reveal his bloated ego. For most of his pastoring career he has been a reverend for the youth group (middle school/high school/college age). He would bring in kids from low income house holds, middle class, wannabe high school gang-bangers, and troubled kids from around the area (they were always Korean kids). My father provided them with certain comforts and in exchange they would have to attend church/religious events. If there were no Korean youngsters attending Sunday service this meant he wouldn’t be able to keep his job. He would preach to them about how premarital sexual relations is a sin, homosexuals were going to hell, the mark of the beast is real, abortion is murder, Armageddon is coming, Harry Potter is witchcraft, secular media is Satan’s work, secular music lyrics played backwards would play a “demonic” message, and the list goes on. You get the gist. He would tell lies to his youth group to scare these kids, and I think my father would feed on this manipulation. I think he enjoyed it to a certain extent.

I was dragged to all kinds of seminars, summer bible schools, camps, missions, retreats, and worship ceremonies growing up. I was forced to be at church or a church/religious related event when I was not in school. I never had any extra-curricular activities or any secular gatherings outside of school. My parents still offer me to send me to a Christian conversion camp to this day. I think it’s called YWAM or TDS. 

I never understood why my family was doing all of this. My father, being the sole bread winner of the house, with a pastor’s salary, meant that we would have to struggle here and there. Apparently my father has an MBA from UCLA (I’ve never seen the degree). I never understood why he picked a better paying career path. 

Anyways I’ll get to the strange stuff I experienced... during the peak of my father’s career I saw a lot of woo woo crazy Christian cult shit. I would be in a worship service with people falling over, people seizing on the floor, people screaming and crying in tongues, and people acting like they were “high” off of the Holy Spirit. People would claim to catch pictures of angels on their shitty flip phones. The mentally weak ones would fall right into the trap. 

One time, my parents advised this family in our church to go see a “miracle worker”. The daughter in the family was a paraplegic. She was hit by a car when she and her grandmother were crossing the street. This family was fucking desperate. The mother of the paralyzed girl looked depressed every time I saw her. I think the paralyzed girl and her family eventually went to see the “miracle worker”. I think the family even paid money to see this conman. Guess what? She’s still paralyzed. These people were seeking some comfort with religion and my parents preyed on them and gave them false hope. 

I’ve noticed a lot of Koreans tend to fall into this toxic cult sect of Christianity. Street artist, David Choe, who is also Korean, experienced similar experiences with crazy Korean Christians. I was wondering why so many Korean people get drawn into extreme Christianity. I know South Korea has a lot of other strange cults that are active in Seoul, South Korea too. 

I just wanted to tell my story. I would love hearing about anyone with a similar experiences."
cults,i6z070,How do cults recruit their victims?,
cults,i6xj9l,Landmark Worldwide is a cult,"This is going to be long. Using a throwaway here and changing names for the purpose of this post. Let me give you some important background on how I was introduced to Landmark Worldwide, and how I came to see first hand some of the cultish, manipulative practices their leadership is using to lure and con vulnerable people right here in Philly.

My first job after my undergrad was in a philadelphia laboratory at temple university. The PI of this lab had a lot of responsibilities for the university outside of just our research, so he delegated the bulk of lab responsibility to our supervisor, we’ll call him Dr. Torple. Because Dr. Torple was the sole supervisor and had the complete trust of our PI he essentially controlled the hiring and firing of workers. One day, about a month after being hired, he told me and the others in the lab that we had an important, mandatory convention to attend for work where we would have the opportunity to network with people involved in our field. What was weird is that this meeting was happening immediately after work that day, no notice, outside work hours, and not affiliated with temple, just downtown at 8th and market. We didn’t get anymore details outside of that, just the time and place.

When we showed up we were told to put on our name tags and wait in the lobby for the “event” to begin. While filling out our nametags Dr. Torple showed up, said he was happy to see us, and went straight through closed doors, not wearing a name tag, not waiting in the lobby with the rest of us. Talking to the others waiting in the lobby though raised more concerns. After about a half hour of waiting, us from the lab realized that were the only ones that had put on name tags. Everyone else was there talking about their last week there, or asking each other “hows the wife”, things that seemed to imply they had known each other or had a history. None of them, When asked, seemed to be involved in the same field we were. When I asked people what the event we were about to take part in the only things people would tell me were, “you’ll see!” Or “you’re in for a treat”. I was definitely worried at this point, and about to leave when the doors opened and we were told to move to the event.

We walked into a big room with two sections of folding chairs arranged on either side of a platform. Directly in front of the platform were two microphones. Dr. Torple was standing at a podium, welcoming people in and telling ”weekend graduates” to please “line up at the microphones on either side and get ready to share”. He turned his attention to us from the lab, asking us all “with a nametag” to please stand up and share our names and the name of our “sponsor”, which he clarified meant the person who invited us there. Telling the groups it was our first time got a huge, excited response, laughter, applause - a huge over reaction, so weird, so uncomfortable. The people lined up at the microphones then went and told one after another how this convention (Which was now being called a program) had changed their lives. One had a huge drug problem until his weekend here at landmark worldwide had given him the “integrity” to take “positive actions” in his life. Another had never had a relationship with his father until the program gave him the courage to call one day.

This went on for a while until all of us “first timers” were asked to leave together and go into another smaller room for sharing exercises. This I think was the most alarming part of my short experience here. We were asked to form duos and talk with our partner about 5 things: 1) our hopes. 2) what we’ve done to achieve those hopes. 3) why we think we haven’t accomplished our goals. 4) what lies are we telling ourselves that are actually stopping us from achieving our goals. 5) Admit that we don’t personally have the ability to achieve our goals on our own. When we were done talking these things over with our partner we were told to tell the group as a whole, and at this point it became apparent that some of the “first timers“ sitting in the group were actually volunteers for landmark itself, hadn’t even been in the first room with us, though we didn’t notice when they’d joined us.

A man in the room, one whom I genuinely think was there for his first time, told a heartbreaking story about his last conversation with his son. One where they’d had a fight and the call ended badly, and they hadn’t made up when his son got into a deadly car crash within that week. Well this sweet, sad man told this story and the response from one of the obvious volunteers was “well don’t you feel like it was your fault that your son died then?” I’ll never forget how hurt this man looked at that question, and when he pushed back they pushed again harder, pressing him to admit that because of his inability to resolve a conflict they knew nothing about, that he was ultimately responsible for the unrelated death of his son.

I was done after that, we were told we could go to the bathroom (I guess we weren’t allowed up to this point) and that when we got back we would fill out the paperwork for their $600 three day retreat. I went straight to the elevator where someone was stationed telling me I needed to stay, that things weren’t done yet and it was too early. Obviously I didn’t care what he had to say and just left.

There’s more I can say about techniques I noticed landmark using, and my experience with my boss after I prematurely left his weird seminar, but this post is way too long as it is. If you hear anything about landmark or know of anyone else using a position of power as a recruiting station for this group I hope a post like this can help raise some red flags and prevent people from being conned in the future.

TL;DR: Landmark worldwide uses cult tactics to convince people they need to spend $600 a week to change their lives and unlock “the possibilities of their life” as they put it."

cults,i55ih6,Totalitarianism within Epoch Times,"In 2016, Epoch Times Group responded to Li Hongzhi's call and began to operate with typical news organization standards, with the Epoch Times website taking the lead. In March 2016, the company advertised on [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com), and recruited seven young journalists who had nothing to do with ""Falungong."" According to former employees, the average annual salary of these reporters is 35,000 US dollars, paid monthly.

According to the five former reporters interviewed by NBC, things seemed ""strange"" from day one. Four of the five reporters requested anonymity, fearing that negative reviews will affect their relationship with their current and future bosses.

As part of the induction training for new employees, big boss Stephen Gregory also talked about his views on Epoch Times' expansion into new media. The former staff said that Gregory’s speech clearly responded to the positioning of Epoch Times as a free mainstream media.

The content of their report is to criticize the Chinese Communist Party, watch the threat of Islamic terrorism coldly, focus on illegal immigration, and spare no effort to promote and promote ""traditional"" values. This also means that there will be no reports on drugs, homosexuality and popular music.

The reporters said that their desks were arranged in a U-shape, and the office was separate and locked, isolating them from the newspaper's other employees, including dozens of ""Falungong"" volunteers and interns. New reporters have to write 5 reports every day and must reach the goal of 100,000 page views. Their report will be submitted to several editors for review-the editorial team consists of two ""Falungong"" couples.

A former employee said: ""(Calling us) Slave Labor may use the wrong term. But a lot of manuscripts are written a day.""

The number of manuscripts is not critical. What these former employees are really worried about is the conservative tone set by the newspaper.

Steve Camelot’s first job in the journalist industry was to write a report on the Trump campaign for the Epoch Times. He said: ""We are countering the so-called liberal propaganda by creating our own media."" Camelot likened Epoch Times to Russia's ""troll farm"" (annotation: the Russian cyber army in Western countries). The article was re-edited to eliminate adverse external comments on the future president.

&amp;#x200B;

A mass shooting in a gay bar in Florida in 2016. The picture shows the police maintaining order near the Orlando shooting scene

Camelot said: ""The worst was the report of the'Pulse' bar shooting."" He was referring to a mass shooting in a gay bar in Florida in 2016, where 50 people were killed, including the murderer. (Annotation: The suspect, Omar Martin, called 911 before the attack, declared his allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Baghdadi, and then entered the Pulse gay bar with assault rifles, pistols and suspected explosives to shoot the murder)"" We are not allowed to report news involving homosexuality, but they also asked to report on Islamic terrorism, so I wrote four articles, but did not use the word homosexuality.""

Camelot said that the media has also begun to change its direction to support Trump. Trump started talking about launching a trade war with China as early as the campaign.

Camelot said: ""I know I must forget all Trump's bad things.""

Camelot ultimately did not engage in reporting on the Trump administration. Eight days before the final election, his team met and announced its dissolution.

A former employee said: ""I think this experiment is over."""
cults,i556qy,any information on Order of the Hidden?,"so i follow a lot of spiritual/metaphysical subs and on a bunch of them like r/Spirituality, r/Meditation, r/astrology, etc, you get it, theres this account thats been posting a lot about their group called the Order of the Hidden. has anyone heard of it?

they advertise themselves as a “community hub” for spiritual people, saying that if you see the post then you were meant to see it, talk about how important it is to make the Order a “home” for those with “missions to fulfill on Earth”, and then REALLY emphasize how theyre NOT hierarchal and EVERYONE has the same rights and theyre like the quakers!! yeah!! its weird.

the Order of the Hidden shared links to their [public Facebook page, ](https://m.facebook.com/orderofthehidden), [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRWZ9mcKAPofrrygT0z-SA), [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/theorderofthehidden/), and[ even a spotify playlist.](https://open.spotify.com/show/1RBvKNXvcDLQJRkjmJghVh) ive only gone through the insta and the big motifs are puzzle pieces, an astral genderless deity in the first post, and that all of the locations for each post come from Tokyo, Japan. 

note: the user is u/ OrderOfTheHidden if you want to look at the template for their posts + all the subreddits they’ve been in. they also have a specific sub for the order, but you apparently have to ask whoever runs the Order acct for permission to join. this really is what caught me off guard about this one. 

this is one of the first times ive seen anything this blatantly suspicious, but i still dont want to jump to any conclusions. has anyone heard of this group before? is it worth looking into?"

cults,i4oejl,"Professor Bauer criticizes Trump family favorite ""The Epoch Times""","A.J. Bauer, visiting professor of media culture and communication at New York University, and his colleagues are conducting a survey of conservative journalists. He said: “It (The Epoch Times) is like a halfway intruder, neither fully integrated into the circle of conservative forces, nor getting along with the right-wing forces.”

Bauer also said: ""Even when discussing marginal media, conservative reporters would only mention GatewayPundit and Infowars. They were rejected by Google, Facebook, and Apple. Called the American right-wing conspiracy theory from the media website), the Epoch Times was not mentioned at all.""

But this situation seems to be changing.

Before 2016, facing American politics, the Epoch Times generally stayed out, unless it was closely related to China's interests. However, the tax report of The Epoch Times shows that the organization’s recent advertising strategy integrates social media on the one hand and supports conservative politicians represented by Trump on the other, which makes it more extensive while doubling its revenue. The American conservative media world has emerged.

Twenty years ago, when the Epoch Times was founded, it claimed its mission to ""provide information to Chinese immigrants to better integrate into American society."" The Epoch Times now uses the largest social media to get involved in various news.

In April this year, the Epoch Times’ advertising spending reached its peak. During the period, according to statistics from the social media analysis company Tubular, the videos produced by The Epoch Media Group (including The Epoch Times and the digital video media NTDTV) were posted on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Shanghai has received about 3 billion views, ranking 11th among all cross-platform video producers and surpassing all other traditional media.

This situation has made The Epoch Times a favorite of the Trump family and an important tool for Trump's re-election campaign. Since the beginning of this year, Trump has posted the Epoch Times report on Facebook at least 6 times, some of which were written by the Trump team. Trump's eldest son also reposted the Epoch Times report several times.

In May of this year, Trump’s daughter-in-law, Laura, accepted a 40-minute interview with the senior editor of The Epoch Times in Trump Tower. The Epoch Times became the protagonist of the ""American Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)"" for the first time this year, which also made it easy to obtain interviews with members of Congress, Trump cabinet members and right-wing celebrities.

At the same time, news websites belonging to the Epoch Times system and their YouTube channels have become a transit point for the spread of network-edge conspiracy theories to the mainstream media. These conspiracy theories include anti-vaccine theories and ""mysterious right-wing conspiracy theories"" (also known as "" Anonymous Q conspiracy theory"") etc."

cults,i4neth,Getting my sister out of YWAM,"I love my sister very much but I feel like after some research on the web, I’ve come to the conclusion that YWAM is nothing but a cult that preys on the young adults. The whole thing sounded fishy to me from the start especially the financial bit where you give them so much money and you have to keep funding yourself. 

She began a few years ago by going abroad with YWAM for 6 months then coming back and committed to 2 years shortly after. She said that God was calling to her come back on staff which okay I get it I thought she was wanting to branch out. 

But now my family and I can’t seem to wrap our heads around it because she’s not getting paid and working a lot. We’re worried she never wants to get back to reality and instead have various sponsors fund her while overseas. 

Her two years is coming up and we thought she was coming home but it looks like she’s recommitting to another branch of ministry within YWAM called the Cleft. 

When I went to go visit her on base everyone was very friendly to me and never pressured me into doing anything I didn’t want to do. The people there were great and she met her now boyfriend through this. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it and she doesn’t want any part of that conversation.
My family and I tried to tell her to get a job or work at a non-profit organization like I do but to her it’s not about the ‘money’. That’s not the point I’m trying to get across but I have said that I’m worried for her to which she says I have nothing to worry about. My mom is a practicing Catholic (I’m agnostic) and whenever they talk on the phone about scripture they always disagree which drives my sister away because either my mom doesn’t understand or doesn’t love God enough. My mom doesn’t agree with the organization either more on the fact that the leaders have no real training other than being on staff for 5 or 10 even 20 plus years. 

Is there anything I can do to help push her into realizing that she needs to leave? I think it’s already brainwashed her and I’m concerned for her well-being.

Thanks in advance!!"

Won't you allow yourself to finally relax, enjoy life and leave the work to us? Don't pass up the greatest opportunity you may ever be offered!

Shakura Brotherhood is a club or organization whose activities and inner functioning are concealed from non-members. Shakura Brotherhood is organized conspiracies working in secret to achieve a hidden agenda. Members use secrecy to protect themselves and their movement. Critics view as malevolent organizations working against the general will of mankind. ‘ Members may be required to conceal or deny their membership, and they are often sworn to hold the Shakura’s secrets by an oath. Violating the oath may result in the application of severe sanctions. Like the most successful forgeries, the most effective Shakura Brotherhood are unknown beyond their adherents. Members may be required to deny the organization itself exists.

IF ITS NOT THE SHAKURA BROTHERHOOD, THEN ITS NOT REAL.

Shake hands with the spirit of money and enjoy a lifetime of wealth, luxury and extravagance.

Live large as you've always wished.

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

We are a Thelemic group working the lesser and greater mysteries of the African tradition as these mysteries have been influenced by the Book of the Law.

We accept all traditions except those whose dogma teaches eternal damnation or the subjugation of women or other groups based on race or creed. We are a society of individuals seeking to improve the planet by application of the principles propounded in the Book of the Law.

Our rites and lore are cumulative and lead gradually to the understanding and intelligent application of that which has been called the Great Secret: Love is the law, love under will

Occultism is much like water. It is neither good or bad in and of itself, but it can be used for both good and bad purposes. It can either quench thirst or drown a man, depending how it is employed. The secrets of the Occult course is meant to be used in a positive manner to help you change life for the better.

We have received several emails regarding our stories on the SHAKURA BROTHERHOOD. Most have asked how they can join while others simply wanted to understand the phenomenon [further.Today](https://further.Today), we look at how to join this secret society. According to the rules and regulations on how to join The BROTHERHOOD, the promise of wealth, success, power and domination simply by joining the Shakura is heresy. Powerful, Influential, intelligent, entrepreneurial, successful and wealthy individuals make up the brotherhood order. In order to join the Shakura brotherhood there is no secret handshake and you cannot just say that you are Shakura family -- when you are part of the New World Order you can rest assured that you will know, without being told. Surrounding yourself with successful people who support your goals, aspirations and achievements will raise your social stature; these people will know you are part of the Shakura brotherhood without you needing to say a thing; this successful and supportive network of people will also be Shakura. Shakura brotherhood members are handpicked through their achievements, ideas and concepts, through their interests or dedication to a cause. The New World Order guides potential candidates to become an Shakura associate, however being guided into the secret society does not automatically grant you a membership. Mutual interest is essential for successful initiation. Conspiracy Theorists have tried to decipher the Shakura's code, and by branding the order as domineering, Shakura worshiping clans in order to gain greed, success and power are a fallacy. Being Shakura is a state of mind, belief in your own success and surrounding yourself with others who believe in the same mindset will successfully guide you on your way. Having a positive mental attitude towards success creates success and success creates wealth, which leads to a mutually exclusive group of people -- The Shakura brotherhood. Opening your mind, dreaming and strive for success in your own right and leading by example are all traits of successful candidates and members.

JOINING THE SHAKURA BROTHERHOOD BRINGS YOU INTO THE LIMELIGHT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH YOU LIVE IN TODAY. YOUR FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES ARE BROUGHT TO AN END.

cults,i3ihyp,My Journey Out of Falun Gong,"FYI: Falun Gong is a religion/cult with some weird teachings (e.g. science and race mixing are alien plots to replace humans) that is persecuted and suppressed by the Chinese Government. Their leader is called Li Hongzhi. They're behind the theatrical dance group *Shen Yun* and the pro-Trump newspaper *The Epoch Times*. Here's one of Li's lectures to get an idea of his insanity:  [https://en.falundafa.org/eng/lectures/19980904L.html](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/lectures/19980904L.html) 

Hello everyone! I am a former follower who has recently left about nine months ago cause by me leaving Mum in Sydney for Dad in Perth. I'll try to be as unbiased as I possibly can throughout my summary, here we go.

My Mum joined the practice after she gave birth to my younger sister in 2006, and she told me that when she read ZFL, she saw that the characters or swastika symbols or faluns (don't quite remember) started to spin in front of her eyes. It was around then, when I was only six, that the indoctrination started. My mum interrupted any educational videos (in Chinese) I was digesting whenever they started to talk about Evolution by natural selection to lecture me on how it was the 'gods' who directly created us. It was then that she started to expose me to numerous FLG propaganda films like one about a certain practitioner being persecuted to death by the CCP. I was also exposed to The Nine Commentaries later on, and that fueled my paranoia with anything 'Communist'.

My Mum and Dad would frequently have conflicts over her practice, with my dad often getting angry whenever she started to chat with other practitioners and going to Mum's room to demand that she be quiet. He also frequently destroyed the scriptures, leaflets and other FLG paraphernalia she had. This has unfortunately led me to develop a fear towards my dad. This ended in my Mum separating with and divorcing my dad and I went with her. She moved to Sydney owing to better opportunities, a larger base of practitioners and due to my Dad visiting her (for the sake of seeing and interacting with my Sis, whom he loves) without her permission and I went with her.

One of the factors in helping me break away from Falun Gong is me developing a desire for debunking conspiracy theories thanks to the discovery of the skeptic community. What fueled this was due to me hearing of all the bad news by conspiracy believers (a la Naturalnews) about the US government coupled with their promotion of 9/11 trutherism, water fluoridation conspiracies and others. This combined with my blind support of the US implanted by Mum (which still makes it hard for me to come to terms with some of the shady shit the US has done or is up to) lead me to adopt an anti conspiratorial stance, especially in regards to western governments. It is through the skeptical community that I have learnt to not trust anecdotes, what logical fallacies are and how to spot them, and about the teachings of Li on race mixing. His race mixing teachings really shocked me when I first learnt about them before reading up on them. This also lead me to become somewhat skeptical of what FLG was teaching about Communism. Another thing that lead me a path out of Homophobia was me getting pissed at another student at my school calling me gay, and the school counselor coming to reassure me that there ain't nothing wrong with being gay.

After moving to Sydney was when I started to question some of the key tenets of FLG like their narrative on the whole 2001 Tiananmen self immolation incident. The questioning then was still half hearted owing to the deep seated fears of overturning everything that I believed in. This half hearted skepticism even seeped into my analysis of The Nine Commentaries. Around this time was when I began to develop intrusive thoughts regarding Pedophilia and I even thought that seeing children was beginning to make my you know what tingle. This is what led me to spiral back into FLG after my brief stint of skepticism due to desperation that this is uncurable, as well as my mind associating such thoughts and urges with sexual orientation in that it might be genetic and innate, that I didn't choose it and that it would be a forever defining part of me.

However, the decisive factor in turning me against FLG was when mum watched a conservative 'documentary' called 'Agenda: Grinding America Down' which explicitly pushed climate change denial that made me aware of just how far down the rabbit hole she was going. I was aware of climate denialists and their argument as well as the counter-arguments to a certain degree, but not very well versed in them. I also recall something along the lines of Li sending some message to practitioners suggesting they watch this 'doco', but I'm not certain in that regard so take this with a grain of salt. I suppressed questions regarding this (and other topics e.g. Feminism and homosexuality) for a while before coming out to my Mum about them as well as occasionally responding whenever she started shit talking atheists and atheism. This is around the point when my relations with her broke down.

I also proceeded to discover the sequel to The Nine Commentaries called 'How the Spectre of Communism is Ruling Our World'. I also discovered its promotion of climate change denial as well as trying to smear other social movements (e.g. LGBT rights, civil rights, feminism) by tenuously linking them to the Commies using numerous logical fallacies. This lead to further conflict between me and Mum, leading to her trying to read the chapter promoting climate denial to me, which lead to even more conflict and her further spiraling down that rabbit hole. Part of this is my fault due to my confrontational attitude towards her as well as my personal insecurities about the correctness of climate science due to my lack of knowledge about it. Me telling her of Trump's transgender military ban further deteriorated my relationship with her, as well as his environmental and border policies. This deterioration of my mental state impaired my school performance. This also eventually lead to two hospitalisations: once due to me getting so out of control at school that they called my Mum and I proceeded to flip her off with both hands and call her out on Shen Yun, the second time being me making a mess of the room with her FLG scriptures after realising that the ancient Chinese didn't have much beef with being gay. This led me to take medication to control my outbursts. Around this time was when I started to see organisations like Headspace and Beyond Blue for counselling. Another incident occurred when I started grabbing a broken vacuum cleaner outside the house and smashed it into the grass due to the cognitive dissonance regarding Environmentalism and Communism as an attempt to vent out my frustration in fighting against my programming. This lead to my mum growing understandably concerned and then telling me to repeat 'environmentalism is communism' ad nauseam until I calm down. That's her way of getting me to calm down and remove any intrusive thoughts of mine; through repeating FLG soundbites (e.g. X is an alien invention) or through getting me to read FLG material ad nauseam until they're gone. Part of the reason why is due to her thinking that there exists no other viable option to remove them permanently due to her indoctrination.

Eventually, my relationship with my Mum deteriorated so bad that she decided to send me back to Dad after graduating high school. So that is how I ended up with him again. All this still occupies my mind a lot and still deeply affects me. I currently still have numerous violent thoughts on harming my Mum and other FLGers severely through torturous means. I also have numerous violent thoughts on Li as well. My Mum's statements and the views of Li still frequently replay over and over in the back of my head. It is still the case that whenever I at the very least somewhat adopt a mindset blindly accepting of 'master's' teachings and political views, I am able to have proper bowel movements, and am able to perform the tasks and hobbies I like to a proficient degree. As soon as I develop a logical approach to any of the beliefs of Falun Gong, I am unable to pass bowel movements due to a mental block, nor am I able to proficiently do the stuff I like. In addition, I have a tendency to block out any conflicting information whenever I try to fact check claims surrounding Falun Gong or Trump or whatever, especially if they lead to my anger towards Mum and subsequent fantasies of violence despite no loaded language or even implicit encouragement of violence in any of the information critical of religion, Falun Gong and Trump. I also still respond to Mum's statements in my head rather violently (e.g. responding with utterings of 'I'll kill you'). However, some progress is being made in my journey towards critical thinking (e.g. reading the books of Richard Dawkins as well as The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe). I still have minimal contact with my Mum, and she still tries to help me with managing myself independently, and I still occasionally contact her specifically for talking with my Sis. I never mention the topic of FLG with her since I left.

That's my journey so far, and any help would be appreciated. Of course this all is just a basic summary so some details are vastly simplified for brevity."
cults,i33nm6,Message me if you are interested,"My whole life I’ve felt someone’s presence, a higher being, a dead being, an audience. It might’ve been self obsession or the Desire to be seen but too many times I have had proof of higher communication, too many times I’ve been addressed. 

There is a substance called DMT which can be taken as a drug , which we us humans release naturally two times in our being - birth and death. I have never taken DMT as a drug but have done others for a long time on and off and have had brain injuries and a brain cyst. The brain cyst is located in my pineal gland right where DMT is released and ever since it started growing the suspicions that I’ve had my whole life started materializing, I began accessing information that I couldn’t before, I experienced a new level power. To note, I only found out about DMT a month ago and have had these experiences for years. 

Dreams are more real than the lucid presence. Dreams are more important than you think, they are also our lives and the way they’ve been disregarded explains a lot about the state of the society at the moment. 

I’m not claiming to be all knowing, I admit uncertainty but some things you can’t deny and I want to share my experience, my epiphanies with someone who feels the same way or is interested and together we can reach a higher state."

cults,i2enmw,The Handmaids Tale is amazing!!!!,"https://youtu.be/dVLiDETfx1c



For anyone who has never seen or heard of this show, its a hulu original called The Handmaids Tale, originating from a book by Margaret Atwood. It is based off of a religious cult where a group called Gilead overthrows the US Government during modern times and kidnaps fertile women for their commanders (leaders over each districts) to impregnate them. This is because the healthy birth rate was very very low and almost no one could produce healthy offspring. Their mission was to help grow the population and at the same time, use this as a symbal to the world that they were doing God's work, bringing children into this world when there was such a huge birth shortage. Sorry for any spoilers I may have said, I tried to be very vague. I linked the trailer for anyone who would like to watch. It's such a thrilling show and I could relate to it on a lot of levels, being in a religious cult myself a couple of months ago. I highly recommend it, it's my favorite one right now. I even read the book after I watched the show and got a couple others from the same author. It's so intriguing."

cults,i1vnm4,I knew there was something fishy with his church..," For starters, I was raised 'Pentacostal'. Im not sure how Pentecostal we were other than speaking in tongues. My church was an open, loving, BIRACIAL (gasp) southern church. I can't remember a single hell-fire and brimstone sermon. Our preacher and his wife were 2 of the kindest people and I still quote them. But I stopped believing in anything religious by the time I was 13. 
 Skip to my early 20s. I am dating a guy who's family is religious. He wasn't but his mom and brother were ALL UP in church. Especially his 18 yo brother. He was one of those guys you can't have a conversation without church and Jesus being in it. I find out he is Pentacostal and ALL his friends are from church. He even tells me he doesn't get along with the people at his job because he doesn't want to know if they are 'sinners'. Well I had to see this place. So one Sunday we went. It was a Huge warehouse. Very new agey. Nothing spectacular. I thought maybe my bf brother was just taking it too serious on his own. Until One day brother calls me and ask if I wanted his queen sized bed. I asked why he was giving his bed away? He said he was giving ALL his possessions away. He had Quit his job, dropped out of college, and decided to go into a Ministry course at the church. He had to sell everything he had and Move Into the church! He was even selling his car! My bf was furious but his mom seemed happy. A few months later bf moves in with me and his brother calls to tell us that he can't talk to us anymore because we are 'sinners'. This is when pretty much all communication stops except his mom. He wouldnt come to family get togethers because some of the family were unsaved. Not even his nephew's 5th birthday party. This is too much for his mom and she leaves the church. Of course he stops talking to her too. About 6 months later we get a call from my bf mom and she is sobbing. Brother had called and told her that the church had Found a wife for him and they were getting married the next week. He sent her a couple pictures of the wedding but as long as we were together I don't ever remember hearing from him again. When I started getting interested in cults I eventually came across the name and emblem of Four Corners church and realized that was the church we had went to that Sunday."

A buddy and me have made the game Cult Manager Tycoon as a satirical take on running a cult. It's not educational, but does combine the sillier/darker aspects of cults and, thanks to this subreddit, correctly satirizes ""Flavor Aid"" ;)

If you like games in which you manage a ""business"" and if you have an interest in cults, then you'll, hopefully, like this game.

I know this post is self-promotion, but I think it's relevant to the general discussion about cults. Also, any suggestions for future updates are welcome.

The game is a paid game (Android), but I don't want to be accused of trying to pump sales. We want interested people to be able to play it. So, below are a bunch of free download codes. If they all get used up and you want one, just comment below or PM me. The codes are valid until the end of September.

It’s going to be called a cult so I’m starting a cult I guess lol Religions and Google are cults anyway smh. If you vibe with this list, or most of it but have questions, message me!

* Far, far left politically
* Gender neutral or/and androgynous (male and female at once) God/ Source energy/ Divine Creator
* Incarnation of some sort multiple places, life before birth and after death (universe too organized to not)
* Decriminalize all drugs like Portugal did in 2001, sell and monitor them in proper doses, invest money in rehab, this would eliminate the black market and laced drugs that kill
* Pro LGBTQ and third gender
* Pro black right to bear arms (discriminated against by police for their right)
* Age of consent 14 like Austria
* Sympathetic towards and understanding of ANTIFA and rioters/looters
* Alchemical purification of consciousness through meditation and psychedelics to eliminate subconscious programming
* Drinking age 18 like the UK/Europe (you can die in war but not drink?)
* Legalize prostitution, control over a person’s own body, women can pimp women, give women money
* Religions and many organizations are cults
* Anti ‘fallen man’, no sin or hell exists
* National public free healthcare by taxes

* universal basic income
* Recognizes the patterns of thoughts in our minds viewed and solidified in our brains and reflected in our consciousness (soul) as sacred
* Ancient Alchemy: If as above so below, we have a body, a mind and a soul (consciousness) coming from Source/God soul/consciousness, everything must come from that single creative Force. Making even plants and rocks have a soul, mind, and body in some capacity.
* Free pads / tampons or as a tax write off

* Buy condoms and birth control at 14 instead of 18
* Tax write off or free contraceptives
* Pro pornography but not it’s general unrealistic nature or model of women and men

* Anti global warming
* Due to China’s 2017 stopping of recycling plastic and glass (as it did 45% of since 1992) it’s better for the environment to trash plastic and glass and only recycle other things like aluminum, paper, especially cardboard, and tin
* Pro transcendental meditation and chakra meditation
* Pro healthy diet, food that gives us the ability to live is sacred
* AI is the future
* Tax free student loans

That sounds pretty scary, and - so - I certainly want to help them. It's been building up more seriously over the last 2 or 3 years. I have connections to advocates in many realms to assist - but very suddenly (After a breakup last week) she decided that she needs to go to Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry: BSSM. (I'm not sure how she heard about this place specifically). (she has no real history of 'church' or Christianity) (she's 36 years old)

She threw away her phone and is selling her car, so - she, might be there already. She finally called me from another number - but it seemed like she had a time-limit to talk - and I heard someone nudge her to get off of the phone... so, - as I said, she might already be there?

I don't really know if demons are real... and I just stay in my own lane - because I'm too busy to care - but what *I do know* \- is that a lot of people get taken advantage of... - and that this BSSM seems like a super *cult*. They tried to raise a child from the dead recently and they make tons of money. Their main concern is that they train people to perform miracles (or miracle-like things) and then that those people go out into the world and talk more people into being in their church.

Some of the videos I've found are pretty scary.

cults,i0mnkh,I left the church of christ 4 years ago and have been no contact with my family but now my mom is dying from cancer,"Sorry for the long post..

So I just think I’m looking for some validation or I don’t even know. It’s hard to tell if the church of christ is cult status but for me (30 F) I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair or wear pants or speak during church services. Lots of behavior and thought control stuff. 

Anyway I left and was ex communicated 4 years ago and was basically no contact. After a few years my mom had a heart attack and this triggered my sister to reach out over text. I started talking to them maybe once every two months or so and it was always painful, though not as much with mom. 

Last year she was diagnosed with cancer and in December she almost died. I live literally half the country away and I wasn’t sure how the rest of my family felt about me but I decided to fly there immediately because if she died and I didn’t at least try with her I would have regretted it my whole life. Mom was being treated at a hospital about 8 hours away from where they live and where I grew up. I thought it would be neutral territory to see everyone again. My sister is at the same time the most devout and least crazy. She left the hospital as soon as I got there because church members aren’t allowed to associate or eat with me. She called me later in the weekend and explained why she and her husband had left. It was a pretty painful conversation for me. I hate feeling like I’m something dirty that makes other people dirty too when they’re around me. Anyway I brought my boyfriend with me on that trip and it honestly wasn’t too bad. Mom and dad both treated me normally and acted so normally that I almost thought I’d made everything up in my head. My boyfriend even said they were way better than what I’d prepared him for. 

So I was in more often contact with my family. And moms condition seemed to improve. She finished her treatment and recovered from her tumor surgery. Then in Feb 2020 she took a turn for the worse. Another tumor and her cancer aggressively spread to stage 4. In May Dad called and said she was dying and I needed to come soon if I wanted to spend time with her before she died. 

That trip was me going back to their home where I grew up and it was absolutely traumatic. My dad is an abusive narcissist who views the women in his family as extensions of himself. I ended up staying at an air bnb and visiting mom in the hospital. I couldn’t take being around him. One day mom told me all these plans she’d made with dad for her funeral. She said she knows she’s dying and had some stuff she wanted to say to me. She said that I should break up with my current boyfriend because he wasn’t family and never will be to her. She said my ex husband from the church would always be family and I should get back together with him. After she dies we should move to Colorado because that’s where my dad is going to move and start a church. She wants me to go to church with dad and reconnect with him. She understands that my sister has a husband and can’t just move but implied that because I’m unmarried I can. She started crying and said she doesn’t want dad to be alone. 

I was devastated. I thought she was the one person in my family who would just love me and not put conditions on that love or my life. It finally clicked something in my brain and I realized none of them actually care about me or who I am as a person, not even mom. It was like a switch being clicked in my brain that I had no control over and couldn’t switch back even if I wanted to. From that point on in my trip it was like I was dead inside. I left about a week later and went home.

About a month ago the doctors gave mom 3 months to live. The cancer had spread through the chemo and any last ditch alternative medicines we’ve tried. My family wants me to come back and see her again but it was just so painful last time. I can’t even handling being on the phone with any of them with out breaking down in tears after. The guilt of not being there for mom -of not WANTING to be there for mom, the pain of feeling like a dirty dish rag, the devastating knowledge that I’m a disappointment, being constantly on guard so I don’t say the wrong thing to set off my dad or trigger a lecture. It’s too much for me. I don’t call for updates and they don’t call me. I’ve called mom like twice but didn’t stay on the phone with her more than 5 minutes. Every day feels like I’m in a daze or fog. The most tangible thing is just how much I hate myself. I can feel myself spiraling and getting worse.

[NoI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam) has been around off and on since 1930. But when [Louis Farrakhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Farrakhan) reconstituted it again in 1977, he led it well away from its ""glory days"" with the famed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X). According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam), ""Since 2010, under Farrakhan, **members have been strongly encouraged to study Dianetics**, and the Nation claims it has **trained 1,055 auditors**.[16]"" See [Nation of Islam Auditors graduation held for third Saviours’ Day in a row](http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_9651.shtml) in NoI's own publication, *The Final Call*. Quoting therefrom, ""'To put it simply, Dianetics works,' said Min. Farrakhan’s Student Assistant Minister Ishmael Muhammad. 'It’s a proven tool but we would not have that tool in our hands if it were not for a man who loved us enough to find something to help us to improve our condition,' he said to a cheering crowd.""

Auditing is one of the CoS's *fundamental* tools of coercive persuasion. 

**Is the NoI a cult?** 

One cannot answer that for sure without looking into the organizational hierarchy of any *particular* ""brand"" to see if it [operates like this](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) in a manner that meets most of the requirements set forth by the experts who put together the various lists of characteristic in [this article]( http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html).

The control imperatives of the leaders on the upper two or three levels of each congregation's organizational [pyramid](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) vary considerably. Some ""hurt people hurt other people"" because, on the persecutors' [Drama Triangles](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html), victimizing others *is* imperative so that they do not have to experience *themselves* as victims.

You can go look at all the various cult models in [this article](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/coercive-persuasion-and-attitude-change.html), of course. (And that *will* be instructive.) But at the bottom of it all, widespread evidence of [Religious or Cultic Trauma Syndrome](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/10/marlene-winells-religious-trauma.html),
the right-side-up pyramid and the upside-down triangle are the essential criteria.

Farrakhan was widely rumored to have been an organizer or participant in the public assassination of Malcom X in 1965. His history with the NoI has been startling similar to [David Miscavige](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=David+Miscavige)'s in the CoS: That of an extremely ambition, often ruthless ""[Young Turk](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=%22young+turk%22)"" who portrays himself as a patron saint of African Americans, especially in several, large Midwestern cities, as well as throughout the state prison system nationwide. Like Miscavige, he has enormous power with (and over?) ""legitimate"" politicians, which some assert is why every investigation into his possible involvement in the Malcom X murder had come to naught. 

Some -- especially those who have seen NoI in various prison systems -- suggest that NoI is becoming the ""CoS on steroids,"" and may even be a well-hidden player in the attacks on certain, selected businesses that have occurred during the otherwise legitimate BLM, etc., protests in many American cities, especially where the NoI has a large footprint. I tend to disagree with that because I known a long-time NoI member who provided a very good argument why such involvement would be counter -- and potentially disruptive -- to the Nation's actual interests.

Which are the perpetuation and growth of a [Cultic Pyramid](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-pyramid-model-psychodynamics-of.html) with the Pharaoh Farrakhan at the top."
cults,hzmzpm,Is my mom helping start up a cult?,"  My stepdad is really into space photography as a hobby, my mom just follows him around. He and my mom joined up with some other people to buy a huge piece of land under the premise of using it to have less light pollution and a better view of the sky at night.

  This was instantly their only hobby, they have spent at least $200k+ in the last year on this. ALL they talk about is how rich, smart and powerful the other people are that they are with.  They spend 90% of their time there now away from home.  Apparently someone named a lake after my mom on the property.  When she showed me it looked more like a puddle but that’s neither here nor there. They are all constantly working building structures and making plans for their “sky village”.  My mom apparently sits in the RV while everyone works but insists on always being there. I have never been there and it is pretty understood that you are not welcome to invite yourself. 

  When they joined up with these people they also became vegan, lost a TON of weight and their demeanor changed dramatically. My mom is bipolar and extremely codependent and has essentially linked her whole identity to this new club she’s in but doesn’t do anything for. it is like talking to a stranger now.

I know times are confusing, but things really aren’t as they appear. I’m only saying this stuff to prepare you for what’s about to come, the physically dramatic shift will begin in August. 1110.

cults,hyt3j8,William Branham - false prophet?,"I know several people who grew up following the teachings of William Branham, including my boyfriend of many years. I went to maybe no more than 10 Message services myself as a result, and I am very curious about the validity of this religion and if it constitutes as a cult.

So by definition, a cult is ""a new religious movement."" Often associated with cults is the ultimate dictatorship of one's lifestyle. This definitely checks the boxes. The women were not allowed to cut their hair, could not wear skirts above the knee, men could not wear shorts, no alcohol was allowed, and various churches had different levels of extremes on what they could or could not do. I know that some churches took it to the extreme when Branham warned against the dangers of genetically modified animals and everyone turned vegetarian, while other churches just took note. 

Okay, I can forgive the over-analyzation and false interpretation of a side comment by Branham. Religion is a hell of a drug. But what I would like to know, is Branham really a ""prophet?""

If I had to define him, it would be a strict and influential preacher. I do not believe he was ""sent from God"" to start a new religion, and I definitely do not believe he was the last prophet. This man just preached the correct words at the correct time, and he gained a cult following.

What rubs me the wrong way is when these churches are set up and the people say, ""We are non-denominational! We just follow the true message from God"" and then they 90% of the time listen to Branham quotes and recordings, and maybe throw in one or two Bible passages in there. The purpose of a church should be to study and interpret the Bible, not study and interpret some old preacher's version of the Bible. When a picture of this man is displayed right along side Jesus, that lets me know it's definitely a cult and that these people have got their priorities all skewed.

Some ""proof"" that he is a prophet is the Pillar of Fire picture. I guess there's some famous picture of Branham and there's a halo above his head, and nobody knows how this developed into the picture because it was impossible to do at the time. More proof of him actually being a prophet was him ""predicting the future."" In my opinion, the predictions were pretty vague for interpretation.

I guess this cult just bothers me because while my boyfriend does not actively participate in the cult, I feel there is still a part of him that believes in Branham. Which is alright, he is free to believe what he wants, but as an outsider looking in, it all looks crazy to me. He says that it's just because I haven't been in the church and I do not study the teachings. Which is true. All I have done is a brief Google search of this man.

Is there any solid evidence and proof that this guy was a fake? I know he did healing ministries at one point, and I guess my boyfriend knows someone who knew someone that was healed(?) 

I know there's that website that goes extensively into proving he's a false prophet (I believe it's [william-branham.org](https://william-branham.org)?) and there's so much research and documentation. But I am not sure if it's written by an ex-member of the church or just a guy really into cults? Where can I get some true information about this man?"

Basically i have been asked to gather as much intel as possible to determine if they are harmful or not, but i feel like i haven't got enough info yet. Any help is appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

This is happening in Serbia, Vajdaság right now but (I think) it originated from Hungary. The cult's name is (Hungarian) ""Keresztény esszénus egyház'', or what i found on english ''Christian Essene Church''.

They do gatherings and then they (try to) communicate with angels and 'Cast' some protective spells on themselves.

As an example: My cousins's eyesight is not even, one of them is somewhat weaker. The optician said that we have to stick the better eye down to strenghten the other one. But, my cousin's mother and his grandpa doesn't do that, instead they gave him an Atlantis Ring to wear. (On the right hand, pointer finger) Which then should strenghten his eyesight.

It is also known that this cult has 90% all divorced members, but i'm not totally sure about it.

Sometimes the lady would sit lotus position for just hours and hours, perhaps even the whole goddamn day. One time when my dad and I were leaving the consulate we passed by the lady who was handing out newspapers (probably the epoch times?). My dad tugged at me not to take it, but I still took one because the lady was very nice and smiling.

cults,hxt8dk,Love Has Won. Let's take it DOWN!!,"! I have been looking into this group called Love Has Won and it is crazier the deeper you get. They have livestreams on their facebook:[https://www.facebook.com/LoveHasWon1111](https://www.facebook.com/LoveHasWon1111)

They ban anyone that dissents. They all believe that a woman named Amy (who is an abusive alcoholic) is in fact really God and there is a ""father god"" as well. They have a house in Colorado and from what Ive seen, they put vulnerable people looking for family to work and make them do everything for them and their ""mother"". This includes paying tons and tons of money. They are trump loving republicans, I assume it is because they believe in this whole ""woke"" conspiracy theory stuff where they think they know the truth and the fake news media is trying to ""rape"" and censor them. Pretty outlandish stuff. Right now, the mother(this lady, her name is Amy) has traveled to Hawaii and claims she is going to ""ascend"". I have messaged multiple members I came across on the facebook page and despite their claims of transparency and being willing to educate others, they do not respond to me. But I wouldn't be surprised if she is actually going to commit suicide. They talk a lot about how she has been weighed down by other peoples' ignorance and ""ego"" and wants to leave her physical body. I wonder if this is a way in which we could help take these guys down and stop the abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't want to get on their bad side yet, simply because they shun anyone that dissents and talk shit about them on their livestream and Im not hating, just curious. I am trying to learn more. They have a website as well as blogs and radio posts. Yet they never really explain any of their beliefs. They write their""Universal Laws"" and other core beliefs, but they just hold them as fact. They hint to her journey in the livestreams and I think there is a story behind it that they either are keeping from people, or reveal to you only for money in their ""sessions"". They all seem like lost souls who have found something they truly believe gives them purpose, yet it is really sad that these people completely turn their back on family and loved ones. Also, there is a lot of talk about how they leave people alone in the mountains without supplies as a way to punish their members, and I believe one such member has died. I hope they all realize that this lady is crazy and they have been manipulated, but like many Trump supporters, when shit gets more insane and further from reality, they think it is the truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what can be done to help people like this, and their families. What they are doing is completely legal (except the copious drug use of course). So it will take something drastic for anything to change. I guess all we can do is spread a message that there is a life outside of that lifestyle that is completely ok to live in and you can find love without giving your money and life away to a program that will turn its back on you for falling out of line. I hope everyone in this cult, yes it is a cult, find themselves and can move past this, but this is a very sad fate of our society. Some people are so lost and vulnerable that they will dedicate their lives to someone that claims they are God, aliens, energy, and vibrations. It is a deep dark rabbit hole, and to my knowledge, it is relatively unknown. They have about 15k followers but who knows how many are throwing away everything for this woman. If you know someone effected by this, reach out and do what you can to be there for them. This is a devastating thing, and people should be more aware of it. I really hope this doesnt turn into Heavens Gate Cult. It sure sounds eerily similar."

A glandular issue causes an odor that repels most people.  I spend most of my days now doing nothing.  Yesterday I tried to see how long I could stare at the sun.  Something is wrong with my eyes now.  I'm really bored.

A cult seems like it could give me something to do maybe a place to sleep and mooch off of.  As long as I dont gave to be castrated or something weird."

I lost my best friend to that ""religion."" Her father, a man I called Dad for yeeaarrsss, was the head of it (I truly had no idea until after high school graduation). After he divorced her mum in high school, she decided to pursue a better relationship with her father and dropped her entire life to be a ""Reverend."" A few weeks after she told me about the first retreat she went on, she formally told me she was changing her name and she could no longer be friends because I didn't believe what she believed. It's been heart breaking over the years. We reconnected once. She was happy. I think about her often and miss my friend. Her father was a psychologist who lost his license after it was discovered that one of his clients signed over her home to the order and donated large amounts of cash. Apparently they did some reorganizing a few years back.

I've been following this sub for a while and curious if anyone else has followed this ""religion?"""

cults,hw24l3,“The Father is God” Ed Havaich 199,
cults,hw0t7b,"Self-Proclaimed Monk in Northampton, MA is a dangerous and manipulative Cult Leader who preys on college kids. Calls himself ""Sacred Elder"".","I am a senior in the five college consortium of Western MA. Last summer, a good friend of mine was approached by a man who calls himself ""Sacred Elder"" while walking through a farmers market in Northampton. Shortly after meeting him, she dropped out of college, renounced all her worldly attachments including her name, cut off contact with everyone she knows, and then **LEGALLY MARRIED** and moved in with Sacred Elder. I am making this post partly to warn off anyone who might come into contact with him, and also as a cry for help. I miss my friend terribly. Is there anything I can do?

Sacred Elder's real name is Eddie Bartok-Baratta. He also calls himself ""Samana"". **He is in his 60s. My friend is 21.** Under his rule, my friend is not allowed to :  
\-use the internet  
\-contact family or friends  
\-leave the house without Sacred Elder  
\-drive a car  
\-have money  
\-***give hugs*** *or have any physical contact with people other than Sacred Elder*  
She has shaved her head, and she now wears the same garb as him. Round black hat, neutral draped fabrics. Her new name is ""Sacred Journey"" in his honor. She no longer uses ""I"" pronouns and will only say ""We"". When referring to her family, she says, ""The Sister"", and ""The Mother"". She will never use the possessive pronoun ""my"", as in her mind she now has no self. This is all due to the ideology that he preaches, which promotes destruction of self and surrender to the divine oneness. 

My friends and I spoke to her once almost a year ago now. She had vacant eyes and always looked to Sacred Elder before speaking. She refused to hug us and when we called her by her name she said ""That person is dead now."" After seeing her, she called us (while being monitored by Sacred Elder) and told us that we were evil and we were never to contact her again.

Her family tried to contact the police, but the police said there is nothing we can do. We reached out for legal help and got a similar story. Through our investigations we eventually learned that Sacred Elder is friends with many people in the police department as well as the local judge. People who have tried to speak out against him in the past have been met with a legal system which always sides with Sacred Elder. He is also known for legally attacking anyone who tries to speak out against him. 

**My friend is not the first.** Sacred Elder has been doing this for years and remains untouched. There have been two girls before my friend. The first was about a decade ago. This girl, named ""his attendant"" was given the title ""Sacred Little"". She lived with him for 6 years. At this time, I've heard he had somewhere from 5-10 followers along with Sacred Little. During this time, Sacred Little had a child. She has no memory of this child being conceived. Sacred Elder vehemently denies it being his child, but he also refuses to take a DNA test. Since escaping Sacred Elder, which was almost a decade ago, Sacred Little has been in trauma therapy for the harm he caused her.

I know this because my friends were briefly in contact with a journalist who lived in the same housing unit as Sacred Elder and my friend. This person was trying to befriend the pair in order to ultimately help my friend escape. We stopped hearing from this person when COVID hit. The journalist supposedly tried to get in contact with Sacred Little as well as the girl who was involved with him before my friend, but they did not respond. 

Sacred Elder has some medical issue which is very painful for him and requires him to have a constant caretaker. This is the role my friend now plays. The two of them also collect leftover food from restaurants and deliver it to the homeless population in Northampton. You can see the two of them most days, wandering town in their matching black hats. My friend is usually pushing a cart full of vegetables. As far as I know, my friend is his only follower right now. 

Here is a video of Sacred Elder and Sacred Little:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjRoYNahBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjRoYNahBQ)

A concerned person once wrote an article regarding him, but as far as I know there was no follow up. [http://hamptonite-forum.1077582.n5.nabble.com/An-Open-Letter-to-Enterprise-Farms-td29.html](http://hamptonite-forum.1077582.n5.nabble.com/An-Open-Letter-to-Enterprise-Farms-td29.html)

Some Smith College students released an article condemning him and warning people to stay away after they learned about Sacred Little, who was a Smith student. I can't seem to find this article anywhere. It seems all of the information online is very out of date. 

With quarantine, I can only imagine that my friend is becoming even more isolated and brainwashed by him. My friend group have been trying to figure out how to help her for the past year. We've talked to many legal professionals but so far it seems like we are powerless. 

My friend used to be such a loud and joyful person. She was known in our friend group for provoking giggle fits and cuddle puddles. Now she looks empty. She does not smile or laugh. She does nothing other than what Sacred Elder tells her to do. A couple months ago, someone in my friend group ran into her and Sacred Elder. This person said to her, ""I will always love you"", and in response, she immediately began to cry. I know my friend still exists somewhere beneath all the brainwashing. A lot of what I've come to is that she just has to get herself through this. She has such a strong soul and I truly believe that one day she'll escape him. Still, I do not want to sit by idly if there is something that can be done."

cults,hvma8v,"Jiang Zeming, the former leader of China's Communist Party, labeled Falun Gong as evil cult for justifying Jiang's brutal persecution"," 

The label “evil cult” was given to Falun Gong by Jiang Zemin several months into his campaign to crush Falun Gong. Jiang bypassed the Chinese legal system and initiated his persecution via edict. On July 20th, 1999, without warning, Falun Gong practitioners were arrested in large numbers throughout China, though having broken no law. On July 22nd, a massive propaganda campaign demonizing Falun Gong was launched which spurred even greater numbers of arrests and incarceration. The persecution continues today and has caused terrible suffering to innocent people.

The US Freedom House’s *Written Statement for Congressional-Executive Commission on China Hearing - Falun Gong: Review and Update* {[The Origins and Long-Term Consequences of the Communist Party’s Campaign against Falun Gong](https://freedomhouse.org/article/China-communist-party-campaign-against-falun-gong)) says:

&gt;“One more point deserves clarification. The CCP and Chinese officials typically assert that Falun Gong needed to banned because it is an “evil cult” that was having a nefarious influence on society. The claims have not held up to scrutiny when investigated in China, nor when one considers Falun Gong’s spread in other parts of the world, including democratic Taiwan. As importantly, in the context of the current discussion, it was only several months after Jiang initiated the campaign that a resolution was passed punishing involvement with “heretical organizations” and that the Party’s propaganda apparatus zeroed in on a slightly manipulated English translation of the Chinese term xiejiao to claim that Falun Gong was an “evil cult.”\[17\] Unfortunately, today, media reports about Falun Gong often erroneously state that “Falun Gong was banned as an ‘evil cult’,” with little further explanation. In fact, the label came later and as noted above, the reasons behind it had little to do with anything “evil” about Falun Gong. By using this incomplete reference, media inadvertently repeat the Party line and may plant the thought in readers’ minds that a repressive campaign that has turned millions of lives upside down might be justified.

It is worth noting that the resolution mentioned in the Freedom House report above, which was passed in October 1999 by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China did not mention Falun Gong at all. Following the Resolution, in 2000, The China State Council and China Public Security Department published a list of illegal cults, which did not include Falun Gong either. There is no legal basis for Jiang Zemin’s persecution, according to one European Parliament testimony.

cults,hvkgwa,Questions for Ouija session,"Someone asked me recently if using the Ouija board is risky:


The way I see it, of course you risk talking to bad spirits of course.  But it goes deeper.  You risk the bad spirits pretending to be good.  And then on top of that you risk your own sanity talking to good spirits either by believing them and the information is so profound that it blows your mind, or you just mistakingly think the good spirits are bad, and it leads you astray as if you talked to a bad spirit. . .


Since late 2017, I've been talking to a spirit named Mary.  The board works for my girlfriend but not for me.  I know it's real because she watches TV or reads an ebook during the entire session.  I just put my hands on the planchette to make sure it doesn't tip over.  It's my passion so I do all the interviewing. . .  I post all my data in my books online.  The first one is at http://www.detailsofrealityhome.wordpress.com


I've been on vacation the past two months but in August I go back to living with my girlfriend.  I'll be interviewing again.  It'll be filmed on my phone camera. . .  Here's some of the questions I am going to ask:


Q: Will meditation and going into trance state make it easier for me to get in contact with high vibrational spirits?


Q: Do you in the fifth dimension literally vibrate at a higher vibration than 4D and 3d people?


Q: Were you initially my guide to find me Leslie, or was it as an all purpose guide?


Q: Has your role as my guide changes over the years?  How?


Q: Can leaders see both my flesh and soul threads?


Q: Are the six lokas real?


Q: Are floating cities real?


Q: Can some mediums have their orifices purge precious stones?


Q: Do good/nice entities vibrate literally higher/faster than bad/mean entities?


Q: Do Whisps go to 4D?


Q: Are Whisps humanoid?


Q: Are there any Anshar in 3D?


Q: Do Anshar start out in the realm before ever incarnating?


Some or many of those questions you might not understand unless you've read my data already, but idk maybe you will.  But, does anyone her have any ideas or questions for me to ask when I get back with my girlfriend?"

He asked me if I practice and I said I dabble - purely for protection...luckily.

He said if I change my mind to let him know. 
He never came back.

Then this lady came in a little while later - maybe months later - and she had a young man with her wearing gothic clothing including a collar and chain to be toted around like a puppy.

cults,hudrxs,Bay Area sex cults?,"A year or two ago, I was stuck in an Uber pool minivan. There were so many other riders, we must have picked up/dropped off 4 people between my stops. The type of ride where you pick someone up from treasure island, even though you’re going between two places in Oakland. Just weird.

Anyway, the uber driver was a cool dude and i asked him about his accent. He told me about how he was indoctrinated into a sex cult back home in Australia, and they asked him to move back to California with them. He just packed up all his belongings, put em in his moms attic, and left.

Apparently upon landing in the U.S. and going through customs, someone fucked up. Instead of stamping his visa for one month, they stamped it for a year, which allowed him to apply for citizenship and remain in the U.S.

He told me he eventually escaped the cult, but that there were tons of sex cults in San Francisco. The kind marketed as tantric massage workshops but end up coercing guests into paying more and more money, even helping them apply for credit cards right there. I guess there’s a ton of socially starved techies who will fall for that stuff, who knows.

Sorry if this isnt formatted properly it isn’t as great of a story as I remember it being. I was wondering if anyone else had heard of sex cults in the Bay Area."

I also felt emended terror and anxiety and felt completely detached from reality. At the time I was into all the new age bull crap with ego death and awakening and it frightened me that I was stuck in that state. I’ve since began my recovery from the meditative induced disassociation and began my journey back into my body and to feel like myself. I hate anything “spiritual” now and I want to live a normal happy life with my family and friends. I wanted to ask if anyone as experienced some th but similar and if so how did y’all recover. Also how do you explain what is happening in a scientific lense that th Rae practices are basically disassociating you from yourself.

cults,huabig,i wasn't raised in a cult but...,"i was raised by a mother with very many religious delusions which impacted both mine and my sister's life,i will go ahead and give a few examples

1.she told my sister to stop taking her psychiatric medication because it would ""destroy her psychic powers""

2.when i was the only one living there she would often follow strangers around and start conversations with them claiming they were her ""family"",with the exception of one time where she followed a truck driver outside and brought me with her,i was very upset because i assumed she knew him and then she tried to tell me he was a rapist and it was our job to stop him,keep in mind the first time we ever met him was that day in that restaurant,but also she would do things like meet a random man and claim that he was her husband in a past life and thus pull me into a conversation with random strangers

3.she would often compare me to jesus christ or would tell me things like i was a ""spiritual warrior"",she would also tell me and my sister we were both aliens and had psychic powers (particularly my sister as i noted earlier)

4.she often used religious delusions to justify her behavior,for example she would justify racism against black people by saying that they ""aren't of nature""

so now i will just summarize her beliefs for you the best i can but please note they are quite inconsistent at times

so i would describe her belief system as being similar to Marcion,she believed that the god in the Old Testament and the God in the New Testament were different gods,and she specifically believed that the true God was the planet itself (im not opposed to nature worship infact id say im a nature worshiper myself but the difference is she doesn't accept nature for what it truly is) and i shit you not the way she described its appearance was exactly like Yivo from Futurama.

she described it as a planet with a singular large eye and tentacles,does that sound familiar to you at all?

but anyway she believed that this God was being suppressed by....okay this part im not sure about,i think it was most likely lizard people (she was pretty big into David Icke) but the point is evil people had somehow taken god hostage and everyone needed to band together and free him.

and once he was free the world would become a second eden where everyone was a white person with red or blonde hair who believed in jesus.

so yeah i wasn't in a cult but id say the way she would use religion to control my life and my sister's life is pretty close"
cults,hu9mox,What makes people have spiritual experiences in cults/outside of cults but related to cult,"My brother has been involved with a small cult for nearly 2 years. He lived there for over a year then was kicked out and told to go home and transform (kicked out for drugs and theft = puts cult leader in danger). The whole thing has been completely terrible and our fun and sweet family member has become nearly impossible to enjoy time with, manic, moody and utterly strange. 

Anyways he has been living with us now which has been terrible and he always is telling me about these experiences he had at the cult or is having currently. Example is he told me of beautiful colours he saw in the sky the other day that melded into each other and were colours he had never seen. Another example is he told me he has recently been walking into dreamscapes he dreamt of years ago. Any ideas?

He is still heavily brainwashed and wants to return to the cult. But the leader pretty much never talks to him and he has little contact with the group right now, so is he just continuing the brainwashing on his own accord? It seems strange that after being home for around 6 months he hasn't lost any faith, since he isn't being fed information by the group like he was when they originally sucked him in. Thoughts? Thanks in advance :)

Kids were heavily encouraged to rat on each other and information gather for a handful of teachers. It was a boarding school so being on good terms w the teachers was important to getting help with homework, extra snacks and lower punishments. If they got an inkling you had broken any rules there was an inner council where kids went in and never came back the same. No one talked about why. I started noticing the personality changes after a few months, there were rewards if you acted as student of ""truth and courage"" which was the schools motto. They wanted us to act a certain way and think a certain way or they would tell us we would fail college and our lives would be useless. There was a lot of elitism and talk about how only some colleges and high school are worth anything and the people who go to less expensive colleges are stupid. There's a lot more awful stories from that place and if you dm me i can share them and I hope everyone stays away from second chance boarding schools or at least meet the admin first.

They'd show up with guitars, singing covers of indie songs and accoustic songs about Jesus. They'd also stand around with signs that say things like ""religion is wack"" and ""tattoos saved my life"" and weird, often random signs alongside things appearing to hate ""organized"" or ""mainstream"" religion. I already had a weird vibe from these people--accoustic jams for college kids and hating mainstream churches was a little too Children of God for my comfort.

Flashforward a few weeks from the last time I'd seen them, there's this hallay in the student center where people might have bakesales, give out flyers, etc. Usually theyre nice enough, generally undergrad orgs, so my guard wasn't up when a dude in a plain black hoodie and a manbun offered me free coffee. 

While it's pouring, he starts asking me about religion and I sort of, a little confused, mention being Catholic. So he hits me with this theological question while I'm putting cream in the damn coffee, and tries to start a theological debate about works and faith, laden with weird non-sequiturs (I can only assume he didn't imagine I read a lot about rhetoric). Halfway through he actually unzips his hoodie to reveal a t-shirt with the same logo as the weird accoustic people, for the church. It was a true shitty protestant super-man moment. 

But as I'm trying to leave to go to my seminar, he asks for my number to continue the debate. Like an idiot, I did it. The next several weeks are full of random texts, always trying to ""gotcha"" any belief I hold and inviting me to all of these Calvary events, of course, using short-out of context scripture quotes. 

I eventually blocked his number, but like. Man, this is cult behavior. 

I'll just leave you with a quote from their website, which is also a red flag to me. 

"" **Everything we do is about creating life change a**nd we want to build and provide opportunities for **change in every realm of life:** spiritually, relationally, professionally, and emotionally. **We want to see people give their lives to Jesus Christ** and become better husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, and employees and business owners. **A relationship with Jesus makes life better—and it makes you better at life**. ""

Anyone else think this is culty as hell?"

She says that ""Because we are unable to speak with you personally, we would like to share some important information with you. Many families are suffering due to the ""Covid-19 Virus"". Some are mourning the loss of their loved ones. Others are dealing with stress and anxieties. Despite these distressing times, can families really be happy?"" And yes they put used quotes around Covid.

They then point at their website and offer free online bible lessons. They also included a pamphlet that they would normally hand out at the door. 

I would think in these really desperate times they would have a larger success rate. Scared people that have nothing to hope for are going to be more susceptible. Plus the website and free bible lessons could be a nice and slow indoctrination method. 

I am sure most people on this sub know what is up with JW, but your loved ones may not. I am going to warn mine."

They pray on vulnerable and lonely freshmen. They will distribute with attractive flyers for free food. Missionaries will eat at dining halls to recruit people. At first, the groups seemed benign. However, little by little, you realize you’re only friends are from only that church. You begin to get cut off from the world and become indoctrinated. I noticed it started getting weird when they would monitor your internet through a website called covenant eyes.  They don’t allow you to date during your undergrad .They only court each other once you in you lates 20s mid thirties. When I attended a wedding they couple didn’t even kiss. Men and women are segregated, you can’t even tell who is a couple. You also couldn’t question the Bible. They seemed to lack theological discourse. If your family was not Christian they ardently proselytize or cut you off.

I am glad I left. Some people may not consider this a cult. However, I grew up Catholic and felt like the Gracepoint Church controls EVERY aspect of life. I began to feel guilty about every little thing. About my secular”music or “internet addiction.” I was damned if I didn’t accepts Jesus as my lord and savior.  What was more creep was that everyone’s drove minivans and wore very similar clothing. I love fashion so this threw me off completely."

You’re singling me out and not only are you wrong, you know this is wrong behavior.” Sometimes I start to write an e-mail like this to a couple of these figures but I usually delete it. 

The sometimes very painful reality is I know if they were self-reflective enough to “get it,” they probably wouldn’t cross the boundaries they did. And in the case of one of these individuals, he tried to intimidate me by implying he could take some kind of legal action against me for criticizing the group- which is bullshit because I never did anything but criticize his behavior within the bounds of the First Amendment - but I’m sure he’d like a “scary” e-mail to try to take out of context."

This made me remember that a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall was built right next to my elementary school. One of my friends was even a Jehovah's Witness around the same time it was opened, I think. All I remember was that she couldn't say the pledge of allegiance with everyone else and couldn't participate in any of the class party's for birthdays or Halloween. Thought it was weird but never asked why, she just said it was her religion so I didn't question it. After watching the episode I googled on maps all the Kingdom Halls near me and MORE THAN HALF are located directly adjacent to elementary and middle schools. This makes me believe that they set up shop near schools to entice their parents to stop by and see what they preach and therefore unlocking a key to the easy prey of their children. It's absolutely sinister. Also I still follow that friend I mentioned earlier on instagram, and she's still a Jehovah's Witness. Since then she has been married at the age of 18 to a fellow Witness. I just hope she wakes up to the damage that Jehovah's Witnesses cause. And I hope she wasn't one of these many many children who have been sexual abused."

Trungpa was a direct student of [Sogyal Rinpoche](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=sogyal+rinpoche) in the traditions of *[The Tibetan Book of the Dead and Dying](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&amp;q=sogyal+rinpoche+the+tibetan+book+of+living+and+dying)* and [Shambhala Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala_Buddhism), which is probably the largest sect of mostly non-Asian Buddhists in North America. 

(Most Thais and Vietnamese are more or less ""Shambhalic,"" but are not necessarily affiliated with the US Shambhala organization; most Japanese and Chinese Buddhists are not ""Shambhalic."")

Received Scientology package out of the blue?!

Until today I had a limited knowledge of the Church of Scientology, believing they were some illuminati-esque cult, or otherwise secretive group, until today when I checked my mail. I’ve never researched the Church of Scientology, nor do I freely give out my address to random mailing lists or anything of the sort, so I’m beyond confused as to why I received Scientology: An overview (a 2 part dvd set).

He was not that person when he cut us off. We've come together to try and figure out some way to get him back, one of us is looking into hiring a private investigator and pooling our money together. 

I'm not sure about anyone else but I have lived a significant part of my life cut off from the world, my parents were not good people and I keep thinking of things that would've or even could've helped me when I was in that place. Leaving him emails, stories about my day, things I'm working on, things I'm excited about, reminding him that he is loved. Keeping him connected. I don't know if he gets them, but the hope is that if I keep throwing this lifeline, one of these times he'll reach out and take it.

My question is, is there anything we can do? Anywhere we can seek help? If exit counselors do still exist, what are their practices like today? Have they developed much beyond what they were.

[https://imgur.com/a/siSdE0L](https://imgur.com/a/siSdE0L)

(I want to remain anonymous so all names and addresses of those involved will not be mentioned)

So my parents had gone out sometime last year and me and brother were exploring our house to see if there was anything of interest (it's an old house and my parents collect a lot of curious items), and we found six old books (3 big, 3 small) from the 18/1900s that seem related to a cult or the occult in some way. (I've attached images)

We were scared to ask my parents about them at first because we thought maybe they were part of it and would get mad or something? But we were just a little freaked out and they are not the sort of people who would be secretly involved in a cult, so the next day we asked them about the books...

They belong to my dad, but he says they were given to him by his Nan, however they actually belonged to his great grandmother who died with them in her possession; her name is inscribed inside so she must have been part of of whatever this organisation is.

She gave them specifically to my dad when he was young and not any of his three siblings maybe because he was the most anti-religion? (or she sensed he had some magic in him ;) )

Years ago one of my dads friends started looking into these books and as soon as he inquired about them, he apparently  was hit by a van and broke every bone in his body. It's certainly a coincidence but I don't think he made any more inquiries after that and it adds a layer of sinister warning to this whole story.

**The first three books:**

These are thick volumes II, III, and IV of ***Life and it's Manifestations: Past, Present and Future.*** *""A series of revelations from interior sources, containing A new system of spiritual science and philosophy, illustrated by examples""*

They also all have a page stuck in the front that says *""This volume is entrusted to the care of (my great great great grandmothers name). As this book is the property of a private society, it is not marketable, and in the case of being re-called, or the decease of the person to whom it is entrusted, it is kindly requested that the volume be returned to (address)""* Obviously this never happened, but it could explain why I can't find any info on these books - they were very careful to make sure it was clear they should not be spread around.

Throughout all the books there is multiple addresses around the world (America, South Africa, and the UK) to which you can write and inquire but they have mostly been crossed out (I'm assuming by my great great great grandma) with an ink pen, or replaced but then crossed out again, as is the word ""*given*"" which is replaced by the word ""*loaned*"".

**The cult itself is only mentioned as being called A.O.L. (America Online link?!? ;) ).** 

**The logo seems to be this strange symbol: a triangle of symbols inside a square, inside a circle: an eye at the top, shining down on both: a flaming heart on the bottom left point, and a sun contain two hands cradling what looks like a feather on the the bottom right point. The bottom right is also printed in gold leaf on the front of each book.**                                                                Typical illuminati, occult imagery...

Inside one it says ""*This volume is the absolute property of the* ***Psycho-Philosophical Society****... Its is privately published and strictly unmarketable. The work is not issued for purposes of proselytism or propagandism, but solely in the interests of* ***pure truth****.*"" 

I have only read some parts of these books because they are very rambling and confusing but I started reading Volume IV and basically, it is a series of accounts of interaction with people in space through the ""astral plane"". They say they had a female ""Seer"" (aka: a medium I think) swap bodies with someone from Saturn or Jupiter so they can experience each others worlds. It describes buildings, the people, cultural differences and ceremonies etc on other planets...

* Vitruvius, A Roman Engineer-In-Chief
* The plane of human embodied mentality
* Robert Taylor

So you can see it covers a lot of stuff. All seemingly bullshit in my opinion, all to do with ""spiritual science"". (I'm a spiritual person in that I believe in a connection to nature, but not a connection to the allmighty alien angel gods on uranus, you know?..)

It seems like all the important names are emitted: even the name of the cult so it is all very secretive and private. 

The mention of ""*Free Masonry""* raises alarm bells because it seems like something sinister is going on behind the scenes with that group...

It could be totally harmless; just some old organisation that is dead and gone, but it just has an unsettling feel to it.

My dad says it probably has something to do with Theosophy and Madame Blavatsky as his Nan mentioned them a lot...

**On to the three smaller books:**

The first is called ***Secrets of Religion*** **by** ***Vindex Veri*** **and with a foreword by** ***BJ Ewins. (1901)***

It is marked inside with the A.O.L. title and logo, has a page removed from the beginning, and basically  talks of different symbolism, teachings and practice within different religions especially Judaism, Christianity and Ancient Egypt. It seems remarkably unbiased; it simply states observations matter-of-factly. Maybe this implies the cult combines all these religions? 

The second is called ***Behind the Veil*** **by** ***BJ Ewins*****. (1904)**

It is marked inside with the A.O.L. title and logo and describes a first-hand account of a ghost encounter. They use a planchette (kind of like a ouija board with a pencil on it so the ghost can write out answers quicker) to contact the ghost of a woman named Florence Law who killed herself, and other 'entities' called Ithuriel, Sofrina, Osiris, Patientia, Theodore and George Dawson (apparently a dead rev from Birmingham). I've skim-read it and surprise surprise, none of them seemed to have anything of substance to say about the afterlife lol.

The third is called ***Moslem Mentality*** **by** ***L. Levonian (1928)***

This one seems unrelated to the others but also belonged to my great great great grandma so I thought I'd share it anyway: from what I can gather, it is a book justifying the Christian missionary ""service"" converting people around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

There is two possible addresses left in the books that may hold some answers, I am going to go to them soon, as well as ask in some libraries etc, and will update if I gather any information.

I can't find anything online about any of this stuff so...

**If anyone knows anything about this I would be very excited to learn more!**

P.S. If I get hit by a car or disappear I reckon we all know why..."

Well, it’s a cult that masks itself as a church. I’m sure there is so many of these out there.

This church is SO weird. The pastor gives himself a ‘messiah’ status and everyone who attends seem besotted with him. Kate’s social media suddenly went from posts about day to day things to posts about scriptures and how great her pastor is and his preaching. She now also shares really controversial things, for example during the covid pandemic in the UK we’ve been really supportive of our health service- and the pastor has been talking it down and saying he has a problem with this? He’s also talking about how the BLM protests are just a diversion from god and following ‘His word’ etc and won’t serve god. Kate also works for the health service I should mention... on the front line, and she’s supporting what he says.

If anyone tries to question her and the, quite frankly, offensive things she shares, she goes into complete defence mode and patronises the person on the other end saying ‘I don’t quite understand what you mean?’ Literally every time. She’s also now blocked a few family members on social media.

I’m not sure if I’m allowed to mention the name
Of this church cult on here but if so I will post a link to stories from ex members in the comments of this post. There’s a website where they speak of how they weren’t allowed friends outside of this church and are told that if they leave they won’t make it outside.

I should also mention the pastor has been in the papers for being bankrupt etc, everyone has a past but I just think he’s a terrible person in general."

I have been approached twice on my college campus by international students who wanted me to join their religion, God the Mother. I guess it's like christianity except they worship god as a female? I honestly couldn't really understand them and I asked them to go away multiple times, but they wouldn't. They wanted me to write down my name, phone number, address, and to come to their weekly meetings. It doesn't sound too abnormal for religions to approach people this way, but their persistence was really weird to me. At first I just said I wasn't interested, wasn't religious, and so on. They hovered around me for over 10 minutes, even when I tried to go back to studying and ignored them. It wasn't until I became VERY blunt that they left. So I googled it when they left because I obviously hadn't heard of that before, and tons of links popped up with people sharing similar experiences. I couldn't really find out how exactly it was related to trafficking, but like I said, it happened on two separate occasions. I was planning to report it to the non-emergency police line but I figured nothing would be done... so I didn't.

cults,hp3k1a,Wanting some outside perspective.,"I grew up in a pretty strange environment. I don't know if ""cult"" is really the right word. More like groups that my parents associated with, then when some of those people started trying to get more normal, my parents and the other more extreme members would sort of ""assemble"" another group with like minded individuals, always weirder than the last group.

First was a home-school co-op my mom and another lady started. It was explicitly Christian and the members tended to hold slightly radical conservative beliefs. Also tended to have above average family size, with 4-5 kids being the norm and a few having 8+. But the group itself pretty much existed to facilitate field trips, holiday parties, and weekly science classes. All members attended church, but not together. 

Meanwhile, my parents couldn't find a church that they didn't start a beef with pretty quick. We hopped around from place to place until they found a startup church, with all the founding members being homeschoolers. At that point they distanced themselves from the original group, some of whom were beginning to send kids to middle and high school(a sin in my parents eyes).

My parents also started getting into some more radical aspects of Christianity and homeschooling at that time. My mom started wearing a head covering(sporadically) and dresses all the time and insisting we celebrate some Jewish holidays, while dropping Halloween and changing Easter to ""passover day"". Got realy into Michael Pearl and similar figures. Started freaking out about the government trying to take away parenting rights(because we had to take a standardized test every 3 years) and talking a lot about moving to some isolated community in the Midwest. 

This was from when I was 12 until probably 15 or 16, my memory is kind of hazy for a few years after that. The founding members of the church started sending kids to school, so on we moved.

We briefly went to another homeschool focused church that quickly fell apart when the pastor was found to have been abusing his kids. My parents and some folks from that church and the prior groups rented a basement to hold services in. I struck up a deal where I was allowed to go back to my old church every other week in exchange for milking the cow. They also bought a bunch of farm animals around that time(we had a couple acres and some run down barns.) I don't remember what happened to that one, but it fell apart pretty quick too. 

We then started going to another small homeschool church. This one was focused on ""family integration"", meaning kids should be kept with their parents at all times possible. No Sunday school, no individual play dates, ect. The core belief of the church was that kids needed to be kept from the influence of the world as much as possible. Young marriage, often under 20, was common and encouraged. Most people had 8+kids, or would proudly proclaims intentions to do so. Pastor would often prophecy about peoples personal lives, accusing people of sins or setting timelines on healings, conceptions, ect. You were ridiculed if you were not conservative, anti vax, climate change denying, or suggested that the government might not be against us.

I got married young to a girl from the church who also wasn't in to some of the weirder stuff. We both were still professing Christians, but wanted to distance ourselves from some of those people. The church later fell apart when he accused an elder of sex abuse(with no evidence but a dream from God) and wound up getting kicked out. The people kind of scattered throughout several more normal churches, and seemed to be normalizing a bit. Now those same people are holding nightly worship services/mask rule protests in the park. They all got back together when they all of a sudden got ""spiritual gifts"" at the same time. After a few weeks of being stuck at home... so now they are all having dreams and visions from God, and using them as confirmation of their stance. My wife is among them too. She started this whole thing in full support of the measures being taken, but after a few weeks took a full 180 and started going to these worship/protest gatherings several times a week.

I guess I've known for a long time my childhood was strange. But its just now kind of hitting me that I might have been part of a cult. Its a very isolating thought. I don't have many friends who aren't at least somewhat still tied to these groups. Those that I do are through work, and I don't want to bring this drama there. I guess i just needed somewhere to type out my thoughts, sorry for the rant."

The skull still had of of its teeth and when you opened its jaws you could look into it's through. The freakiest part of it all though was that there was a hole in it where a black scaly like apendege stuck out by the head. At first I thought it was a snake but it turned out to be a tail that was connected to the inside of the corps which was fully lined with it's fur. The animals comfortably  hand like paw was still perfectly intact to the point where it looked like it belonged to something that was still living. It did not have organsOr bones. Needless to say we were petty creeped out; not only did it look like something out of a lovecraftian horrer novel but it didn't look like something an animal would do. Why would anything take only organs and bones? I don't even think it was a taxidermest because the skull wasn't taken so I'm pretty concerned.

cults,hm079d,Is being part of a Cult good for mental health?,"I am a former Soka Gakkai member a.k.a SGI. In this particular cult, the members are required to chant a particular mantra based on Nichiren Buddhism. But that's not all. The members are required to attend and participate WAY TOO MANY meetings and supposed to form a bond with their mentor (Dr. Daisaku Ikeda) which is outright absurd. But I won't lie that this practice has helped me grow as a person and FEW members have been very kind to me but due to the pressure of attending and participating in meetings I left. Fun fact is that the practice of chanting supposedly brings out our highest potential (which is debatable). Even if it is true, the members are not able to use that potential because they are too busy attending meetings. I am also not a fan of mentor and disciple relationship. I mean, having a mentor in life is good but it would be great if you could reach him, for example, someone in your family or workplace. This so-called mentor has not been seen in public since 2010.

But, despite all this, I have actually met some nice people and there are no weird rituals except for chanting and no seperation from family so I was thinking to give it another shot by practicing individually because I believe the chant really helped me but I can't buy rest of the bullshit. So what are your thoughts?

It will be a realization spontaneously.”  I asked Mary what I was afraid of when she first became my guide.  She said, “Trusting anyone with my heart.”  Then, I asked, specifically, what I was afraid of, when I was twenty-five and needed a spirit guide.  She said, “Of not being capable of having a meaningful love with someone who could nurture your wounds while respecting the unique intellectual experience.  Then, I asked Mary if I was born with wounds.

It is my  intention to get more information about other  people's personal  experiences with extremist satanic sects/violent cult rituals or if I  can get any literature suggestions/recommendations.

We'll  nickname my gay bestie Jeremy for the sake of the story. He had just   gotten out of a bad relationship and was feeling reckless so he made  himself an [adam4adam.com](https://adam4adam.com/)   account, after chatting with a COUPLE'S account, he decided to take   them up on their offer to join them for a party in Bellingham   (Washington state).

The night   before he went, he was out at the bar and his wallet was stolen. He   believes there is a correlation. The day came and he agreed to meet one  of the party goers at a gas station to get picked up, he noticed   immediately that the driver, we'll call him Brad, looked... nervous, or  unsettled. The OTHER passenger, Nick, claimed it was his first time to   this party as well and that he did not know any of the other men either.

They  get to the house, which is near the Canadian border, Brad had made a   comment about how easy it would be to just slip across the border in the   night if you wanted to, which Jeremy thought was strange. It had been   discussed in the Adam4adam correspondence that there would be no  alcohol  at the party.  There are three other men at the house, Zander,  Larry,  and Chase. Larry is emo/gothic looking... Long dark hair, dead  eyes,  uni-bomber vibe, Chase is older, too calm, eyes really far apart,  and owned the home. I can't remember details about Zach.

None   of them looked like the pictures they had sent online, they all had   different hair colors, or were just completely different people than in   the photos. They all laughed and made jokes about how this was their   favorite time of the year, and they always had this party when the moon   was full in MARCH.

Come to find   out, Brad was a drug dealer, a big one in fact, and started dishing out   Molly. Jeremy agreed to take the molly, but when they recommended that   he chase it down with orange juice and nobody else consumed it other   than him, he started to get a bad feeling. Shortly after this, he knew   something was wrong, he became disoriented and began to barf up foam.

The   men led Jeremy to the bedroom, made him lie on the bed, and Larry  began  to play him some kind of creepy death lullaby on an acoustic  guitar. Jeremy said that his body became colder and colder, until he   eventually faded out completely...

He   ""awoke"" into what he describes as some kind of near death experience,   or alternate dimension. Everything was blue, he looked down at his own   body, limp on the bed, and wondered if he had died and if he was in  fact  in some kind of purgatory or some transitional existence.

He   told himself repeatedly that he couldn't die there, and eventually,   after who knows how long, he actually awoke back into the bedroom. When   he came to, Brad and one of the guys were naked and fucking on the   floor, when they noticed that Jeremy had woken up, he could only   describe the looks on their faces as ""confused"". They probably thought   they had killed him with the drugs or something...

Brad   and the other dude got up and got Chase, who began to belittle and   berate Jeremy verbally, asking him to kill himself repeatedly, and asked   him hundreds of times if he wanted to die.

They   tried for hours to get him to kill himself, saying things like, ""Do  you  want to die? Do you? Well you came up here didn't you? You should  die,  because you are so stupid."" Jeremy had no physical control over  his  body, he couldn't move, and he was surrounded by all these men  telling  him that he needed to kill himself.

Nick,   the other supposed 'victim', didn't appear afraid or perturbed by the   situation at all, he was just kind of fluttering around, listening to  Ru  Paul music on his phone like a fairy.

Jeremy   said all of it felt EXTREMELY scripted, from the discussion of no   alcohol, to the intentional drugging to make him appear less credible,   the false photos, and the constant berating telling him TO JUST FUCKING   DO IT AND FUCKING KILL HIMSELF.

It   was as if they needed his consent to either kill him, or they needed  to  widdle him down to make him do it himself. Either way, hours later,   Chase made a call on the phone to a mysterious person ( by this time it   was around 6am) and told whoever it was that ""Things were not going to   plan.""

There was numerous   discussions between all the men that ""Things were not going to plan.""   and they were getting increasingly agitated. One of them said ""Let's   just shoot him up with draino and get this over with already."" another   one of them said ""Let's just chop up his body and throw him into the   bay.""

THE MOST DISTURBING PART   ABOUT THIS ENTIRE SITUATION was when Chase entered the room, naked,   HOLDING A SEVERED ARM! Jeremy said he could clearly see arm hair, nail   cuticles, moles, veins, the whole nine. The other men all grabbed plates   and knives and started scratching the knives on the plates and were   making eating noises, whilst asking him, ""DO YOU WANT TO DIE?""

And even though Jeremy was scared for his life, he told them no every single time.

At   one point, all the men left the bedroom, and the other supposed   'VICTIM', Nick (who drove up in the car to Bellingham with my friend)   could be heard in the other room saying ""I changed my mind, I don't want   to do this anymore. I'm done. I just want to leave."" That doesn't seem   like a realistic conversation between people who had supposedly 'never   met before'. The other men could be heard saying, ""Take him to the  spot  and just take care of him. Take care of him.""....

Nick   came into the room by himself and told Jeremy, ""Well, let's get the   fuck out of here."" And just like that, they were being told to 'get the   fuck out' by the other men. Nick grabbed two large knives from the   kitchen and they left the house...

They're   out on the street now, it's still dark outside because it's so early,   and now Nick is saying, ""Let's go this way and I'll call my mom to pick   us up.""

Jeremy didn't trust Nick   for one moment, it was obvious he knew these men and had denied it, it   was obvious there was malicious intent, and the phrase, ""Just take  care  of him"" was still ringing in his ears.

I'll make the next portion of this story short and sweet--

Jeremy   jumped the fence into a yard a couple houses down and told Nick, ""You   can either come with me or not, but I'm going to this house to get   help."" Nick was hesitant, trying to convince Jeremy to just come with   him down this dark ass street.

BY   THE STRANGE GRACE OF THE UNIVERSE, the house Jeremy approached belonged   to an OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER, who was able to call the  police for  Jeremy, BUT... when the cop got there, it became even more   disheartening....

The cop didn't   believe the story they were telling, he went to Chase's house, which was   now looking very quiet and sleepy, like no one was there but him.   Chase told the cop that Jeremy had taken the drugs himself and had just   freaked out and couldn't handle his shit.

But the strange part is... that the cop and Chase seemed to know one another.

Jeremy   asked to just be taken to the hospital repeatedly, Nick was still   pretending like he didn't know anyone, or what was going on, even though   that was an absolute lie. On the way to the hospital, Nick kept  saying,  ""I'm going have my mom pick us up and take us home, don't  worry.""

At  the hospital, he was  able to run in and create space between himself  and Nick. He told the  nurse that he was fearing for his life and t was  imperative that Nick  could not know what room he was in, the medical  staff must have taken  him seriously because he didn't see him again...

The   story goes on, the cop who came to the call never made a report, and   when Jeremy later called to get more information, they identified him as   ""The guy who broke into the guys house."" There was no report made  about  him being drugged with GHB, told to kill himself repeatedly, the  talk of him  being chopped up into pieces and thrown into the bay or  anything. The  police officers on the phone told him, ""Well, you agreed  to go up there,  didn't you? You willingly took drugs, didn't you?  There's nothing we  can do for you.""

There are more details, but this is the meat of the story. I guess my question to you all is...

1. IS   THERE SATANIC/CULT SIGNIFICANCE ABOUT THE FULL MOON IN MARCH? OR DOES   ANYONE KNOW WHAT THAT TIME FRAME COULD POTENTIALLY REPRESENT?
2. DOES ANYONE KNOW ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HUMAN SACRIFICE, SPECIFICALLY CONVINCING A VICTIM TO KILL THEMSELVES?
3. IS   THERE A CHANCE THAT THE POLICE COULD BE INVOLVED IN COVERING UP OR   BEING INVOLVED  IN SATANIC CRIMES? I realize that sounds like an   outlandish conspiracy theory statement, but the way that officer handled   the case seems so intentionally downplayed.
4. HAS ANYONE HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO THEM BEFORE? Coerced from the internet, stalked, selected, and pushed?

Again,  sorry if any of this sounds absolutely ridiculous, or if this is an  incorrect section to share this story and ask these questions.

We are trying to make sense of this experience.

Thank you."
cults,hl50dj,"What advice can you give someone who wants to leave a cult, but they know their family will stay, and possibly never contact them again?","The background to the question. I lived this situation when I was 22.   


I was born into the Exclusive Brethren, a family Separation cult. If anyone left for whatever reason, the members who remained were not allowed ‘normal family relationships any longer.   


They had to shun, ostracise, withdraw from, have nothing to do with ex members.  


 This destroyed many families and do to this day.  So that’s the background to the question.   


What can a person do in this terrible situation?   
1: Just get out and cut your losses   
2: Stay and research the cult inside out and try to encourage your loved ones to leave also.   
3: Research the cult and write a letter to the leadership and ask for a general enquiry.   
4: Create an awareness campaign to expose the family destruction.    


After I escaped, I created Cult Escape, a campaign to create awareness and to help such trapped people work through their challenge. www.cult-escape.com and a YouTube channel in the link above."

cults,hl3yem,Awe and Fervor in religious conversion,"By Yuval Laor. Link at the bottom:

""I maintain that sudden conversion corresponds to a sudden falling in love, an event seen when people ‘fall in love” with their baby as they become parents, and in romantic “love at first sight”. Both falling in love and undergoing a religious conversion include a very strong emotional experience. They are more common in teenagers and young adults, but can occur at any age. Such events allow a person to fundamentally change his or her life, including changing habits and breaking other relationships; they establish a long lasting commitment which is irrational in the sense that it is not dependent on cost-benefit considerations; and they result in strong feelings, moods and motivations towards the new child, romantic partner or faith. These manifest in the person being either in a state of being in love or in having fervor, both being states that need to be maintained over time through emotional experiences.

Love, being in love and falling in love resulted in various traditions and institutions which we collectively call “family”. I propose that in a similar fashion, the psychology relating to awe, fervour and conversion, resulted in the emergence of diverse cultural traditions and institutions we refer to as “religion.”

So far I have been pointing to commonalities between being in love and having fervor, yet these are different in an important sense. It is clear that being in love includes a commitment towards the object of one’s love. But fervor also includes a commitment toward a specific worldview being true (which is why symbolic language, on which the concept of truth depends, needed to evolve before we could have fervor). This means that in the case of fervor, in addition to a commitment to a figure such as a deity or a leader, one’s commitment includes a belief that a certain set of ideas is true, that some of these are “great truths”, and participation in an emotional regime that determines what emotions are appropriate in various situations.

My characterization of religious psychology highlights the need to reevaluate our approach to cults and cult members. If my assertions are correct, the way a cult manipulates a person is related, in an evolutionary sense, to the ways that a child “manipulates” a parent. If we consider Scientology, for example, we can say that a member tends to view Hubbard as a father figure; but regarding his or her relationship with the group, the member takes the role of a parent who needs to protect and help advance the cause of the group, which in his mind takes the role of the child.

If they think their child’s wellbeing is at stake, parents will be willing to give up their possessions, work long hours, and even act immorally and illegally in an attempt to help their child. Similarly, cult members are likely to act in these ways on behalf of their cult. Both are likely to be deeply offended when their child or their group is insulted. Both resist even considering damning allegations against their child/group. Parents are likely to see even the most demanding and abusive child in a positive light; likewise, cult members tend to judge their group positively, even in cases where the cult is abusive. Parents are devastated when losing a child, no matter how abusive or demanding the child was. And similarly, cult members are shattered when they leave or are kicked out of an abusive cult.
Accepting the similarities between cult members and parents of demanding, abusive children, points to a great injustice in our culture. The parents of a demanding and abusive child are supported by society and are to some extent forgiven for immoral acts they did on behalf of their child. Some even admire such people for following their hearts and sticking by their child no matter how horrible that child is. Even a serial killer’s parents might be forgiven or at least understood for supporting their child. Unfortunately, such empathy is not extended to people who are, or have been, in cults. Far from being supported, cult members are often viewed by society as being stupid, gullible or weak. It is tragic that without understanding the influence the cult had over them, even cult survivors can view themselves in such a way.

On a more personal note, if the person reading this is an ex-member of a destructive cult, I would like to tell them to forgive themselves, and view the involvement with the group as something that could happen to anybody capable of parental love. Don’t view your cult involvement as a failure of your character or intelligence, view it as you would stepping in dog doo: you were unlucky, and you might have stunk for a while, but it doesn’t mean much about who you are.""

cults,hiypl4,Best friend doesn't stop pushing me to join Landmark,"I'll try to be short and concise. I'm an extremely introverted person with only one close relationship outside my family. I've known this friend since high school (we're in our early to mid twenties) and have become very close with him over time. He is very much the opposite of me in terms of character and has helped me tremendously in connecting with other people and gaining confidence. I'd say we have an unusually personal relationship and our conversations frequently revolve around very intimate topics. 

About a year ago he told me about some kind of ""forum"" he attended over the weekend and how it was an incredibly intense experience. I was quite confused at first and he wasn't really able to give me a coherent description of what this ""forum"" actually is. He sort of just ranted on about it and our conversations that day overall felt a little ""weird"" for lack of a better word. Afterwards I read up on Landmark. Now there's some contoversy on whether it should be considered a cult and I abstain from having an opinion because this is not really relevant to my problem. His initial description of a 3x12hours over 3 days event and its enormous pychological impact had already made me concerned just because it didn't sound like a healthy exercise at all to my (admittedly uneducated) ears. The fact that there are people accusing Landmark of brainwashing obviously confirmed these concerns. 

I decided to send him a text message later that day saying that I know this isn't really my business but that I'd personally stay away from this organization. He called me back immediately. After I explained my worries while also stating that I respect his decision either way the entire direction of our discussion did a 180. It went from me being concerned about Landmark to him trying to convince me to join the next seminar. He kept going and I didn't know how to end the conversation without being downright rude because he was so emotionally involved. This resulted in a 3 hour discussion on the phone lasting until 2am in the morning. Since that event our friendship hasn't been the same. Almost every time we have a conversation about personal topics he will eventually transition into advertising landmark. Whenever he talks about Landmark related topics I perceive what he's saying as artificial and unnaturally ""positive"". A lot of the time it feels like he's just waiting for an opportunity to pitch Landmark again. The actual content of what he's saying is totally benign self help crap that grossly oversimplifies the human psyche. Whenever I confront him the discussion I described above repeats itself. 

After about 5 months of this I had enough and gave in to his pressure in hope that this would make him stop and went to a Landmark meeting. It wasn't a full on seminar just some kind of  ""graduation"" event that lasted like 4 hours. The experience ranged from boredom to discomfort. In the end of the event I was approached by a landmark staff member and I agreed to let him present the landmark concept to me. I was very friendly and open but didn't hide my reservations. Later the ""coach"" joined the conversation and neither of the two had a proper response to my criticism (unsurprisingly) and obviously did not convince me to participate. The coach even got a little rude and visibly annoyed in the end. But of course my friend (who listened to the whole thing) found a way to frame it in a way that made it acceptable to keep pressuring me in the following months. (Some typical examples of his arguments: ""You just want to be right and it prevents you from making progress"", ""The unfriendly coach wasn't representative of Landmark, you need to get to know other coaches"", ""you will always find arguments not to do something because you're so smart"") So basically at this point I'm just sick and tired of it and genuinely don't feel like talking to him anymore. Our whole friendship feels ""fake"" to a certain degree.   

Has anyone had a similar experiences? Should I just straight up tell him that I don't wanna hear about landmark ever again? Problem is I don't think our friendship would survive this. Landmark just seems too important to him for that kind of strategy."

cults,hi7qjp,"Mogadao- not so Daoist, very cult-ey, a warning for those considering joining","I  just left a “high demand community” (cult) called Mogadao. Everything  online about this community has been whitewashed, and I’m hoping that if  I post some of my experiences here in this reddit community, it will  actually get some information out there besides the boiler plate, “Zhen  (the leader, formerly known as Daniel Villasenor) is an amazing Master.”  Never clear what she was a “master” of- sexuality, Taoism, supposedly  all of life? Definitely in my experience, a master of manipulation, and  narcissism.

I would like to stay  anonymous while getting this information out there, but also would love  to connect if anyone else has studied or been harmed by this person.

On  reflection, almost everything she told us about her past has not held  up to scrutiny. Her supposed year of solitude up in the mountains- how  is that she returned from that time with tons of plastic surgery (which  she totally denies), and pretty much zero stories of her time. She  supposedly spent all this time in China, yet does not speak a word of  Chinese, or talk of her teachers and their lineage. I have since studied  with some other Taoists that come from actual lineages, and most of the  information I learned from her is incorrect, and some of the practices  are actually dangerous.

The schedule was in constant flux, what I see now as a way to make us distance ourselves from our regular lives.  Commitment and devotion was valued over all, and the demands made to attain being a teacher of the work kept being raised- financially and with necessary time commitment.

I am far  from transphobic, but it is difficult for me to be around someone who  constantly fetishizes herself (whether they are trans or cis). She never  spoke about dysphoria, only about eroticism and sexual experiences as  her motivation for transition. She would blatantly flirt with students  (she touched my dick erotically in front of the men’s class as an  “example” without my permission), then she would kick them out of the  school when they confessed their feelings, or when they would ask what she meant by certain communications. She then publicly claimed  that she was the victim, because everyone wants her now that she has breasts. I can’t help but wonder if she was using her  transition change her identity legally to possibly cover up some shady  past.

A lot of the ways the power  structure was set up, the way language was used to manipulate people and  power, the inconsistencies, constant changes under the guise of “that’s  the Tao…” It was so easy to excuse when I was still in the cycle,  addicted and trying to make the most of these practices that are  supposed to be enhancing my life. Yet at the same time I was struggling  with a deep inner anger, and rage as I tried to analyze all the things  that my inner self knew was just plain wrong. I’ve been feeling so much  relief as time is going by that I’ve distanced myself from the school  and had all this energy freed up that before was being used to make  excuses.

Please upvote this,  comment, or do whatever needs to be done so that this post will remain  online for a long time. And on the off chance that anyone has  experienced this community as well, or has any information on this  person, please reach out. I hope it’s ok that I’m posting it here. I  know some cults and the abuse suffered by members are much worse than  what I’ve experienced, but this organization fits most of the criteria  for being a cult. Thank you for reading.

Amy States that Free will has caused the corruption of Modern day earth, and that, under her reign as a deity, she will remove the very concept of free will from humanity, and restore “Divine will and Universal Laws.” 

I’m seriously worried that if left unchecked, this group could be extremely dangerous."

cults,hh1hz5,I'M CONFUSED. Am I in a cult or a healthy church?,"Hi! So, I've been feeling pretty conflicted recently about my faith and I'm starting to doubt whether or not I should continue being a part of the church I'm in right now (or even Christianity in general). I've done some research for the past week and my church has some traits of being a cult but it also has traits of a healthy church, so I'm really confused. I don't know if I'm bad or wrong for feeling this way. I also read on quora that most teens feel this way about going to church because we want more freedom and being in an organized religion definitely doesn't give us much of that, so we rebel. However, I've been in this church my whole life and this is the only time I questioned my beliefs because I haven't attended church for so long cuz of quarantine which means I'm not constantly being bombarded with the speaker's messages which could be considered brainwashing, in a way. I'm glad that I took some time away from them to be able to think about what I really believe on my own without their influence. I consider this a good thing because I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a church just because I was born into it but I can't help thinking ""what if what they're saying is true?""

My church believes in the usual ""we're the TRUE church of Christ"" and that He would come for us in the rapture and leave everyone behind for the great tribulation because they were sinners and didn't listen to us while we were still preaching to them. Our main leader is an apostle, then bishops, presbyters, pastors, and elders. Our apostle said that he heard a voice and light like Paul when he was called and he saw a vision of cities which, he says, means that he was called to preach to all the world.  He doesn't use the church's tithes (10% of your income) for himself and instead uses it for the growth of the church. The pastors, bible students, and other people who dedicated their whole life to this church also don't get paid which I'll admit is a good thing because it means that there's no corruption (at least I hope so). This could mean that they get used for free labor for the church but it could also mean that they're doing service or volunteer work for the church. They also show us the churches they've built internationally so there's some kind of transparency to where the money goes to.

There's a stigma whenever someone leaves, becomes cold, or questions our beliefs. People would assume that you're doing something sinful or that you've turned into an apostate because the end is near and people will turn cold towards God. This could be true but I believe that just because someone isn't in the church anymore doesn't mean that they can't be doing good things outside of it. People would talk behind their backs and find ways to pull them back in. If you see them as a cult, you'd say that it's manipulation but if you see them as a good church, you'll see it as them just caring about your spiritual well-being because they believe that they're the one and only true church. There's a hierarchy that you can climb by constantly giving a lot of your money and when you can't give any more, you can give up your whole life to them. It means that you have to quit your job and work for the church for the rest of your life. They call this ""discipleship"" and you have to go to ""bible school"" to become a pastor. Oh, they also consider walking out as a worse sin than actually committing a sin and that you could become cursed.

We also don't use any other book other than the bible. Which is good, right?

They give out validation a lot at first which could mean that they're love-bombing newcomers so that they'd stay in the cult or maybe they just want everyone to feel welcome. I'm not really sure because it depends on how you look at it but it does seem really fake when you're one of the ushers because you have to smile all the time and shake everybody's hands. What I don't like though is the amount of positive reinforcement they give and the opportunities they give you to be useful so that you feel like you've accomplished so much in the church and yet in the real world, those accomplishments really mean nothing. Like for example, they do a yearly award ceremony and they give us a bunch of awards to award us for everything we've done for the church for the past year and they also always take me as a muse since I was 12 even though I was really young and didn't really look my best but people would always give me praise which made me more active in the church. They also make use of whatever ""talents"" you have to make you join performances and promote the church. Even if some people aren't good at certain things, they guilt you into joining choirs and stuff so it would look as if a lot of people joined.

They don't really make you cut your family members &amp; friends off if they're unbelievers (like JWs) but it's highly encouraged to only hang out with believers while inviting those who aren't to the church which makes you cut them off yourself. Its a slow process of them filling in the role of being your family so that you won't want to be with your actual family anymore because you don't see the world as they do. This actually happened with my family because when some of us were active, we became cold to the rest of the family because we only want to be with the church which caused some tension and fights to occur. When I was active, I used to sneak out of the house against my mom's wishes to go to church meetings, and when she finds out, she hurts and shouts at me. But now that my mother has been given an important role in the church, she's willing to hurt me when I don't want to attend meetings. My mom also kind of cheated with my dad with someone in the church when she was active and my dad wasn't and my dad did the same when he was active and my mom wasn't  (I don't exactly know the full stories because I was still young) but there was a lot of fighting and it caused a number of unresolved trauma and conflict in our family. This could just be our problem or maybe it happens to a lot of families in the church but we just don't talk about it.

There are also a lot of events in the church which help keep it alive but it also makes us spend lots of money on camps, conferences, and conventions all year round. This is one of the reasons why some go out of it because they can't keep up with the expenses but it also makes you feel left out if you don't come. Those who were able to join, post lots of photos of the events on social media and they constantly tell stories about how it changed their life. While in the church meetings, they also showcase everything that happened while the speaker praises those that came and guilts those who didn't. I feel like it's clearly a way to guilt-trip those who weren't able to come and make them feel bad so more people would come to the events. The manipulation is slow but I can see how it works because they're clearly not forcing you but they say things that push you to conform and give more to the church through positive and negative reinforcements. There are a lot of shame and guilt tactics involved but maybe all churches are like that? I can't really say.

So you see, they have a mixture of cultish yet good church qualities that makes me feel really confused about whether to think they're a cult or not. It even makes me think of Christianity as a cult itself because if they really are the ""True"" church of Christ then I don't really want to be a part of that anymore. I'm wary because I could just be overthinking this and I don't want to act irrationally or maybe I've been woken up from the spell they've cast on me since I was born. What do you think?"
cults,hh04rh,My uncle joined the Church of Unification in the '70s and has not been heard of since.,"Hello! I am new to this subreddit, and I was pointed here by the kind folks at /r/WithoutATrace. I posted there because my uncle has been missing for more than 50 years, and because of my family's lack of resources, he has been assumed dead. But there is no Death Certificate, no place of burial, and no actual information that he is either dead or alive.

My uncle, Eamon Declan Coughlan, was born in Dublin Ireland. He was the oldest boy of a large Irish family, and my dad was the youngest boy in the family. Because it has been so long since my father has even thought about him, some of the details are fuzzy. I know that he left for San Francisco when he was young but older than 16. My current assumption is that he was 18. He lived in San Francisco for some time, and the last correspondence my family ever had for him is that he was planning to join the Church of Unification, which has been since labeled as a cult. I know the Church of Unification was rising in popularity in the time my uncle would've been in San Francisco, the '70s-'80s. My family has not heard of him since. Since the Family was primarily in Ireland, they did not contact any police, assuming it was possible that he was traveling or just couldn't get a hold of them. My dad came to America when he was older, and though he has never claimed it was to look for his brother, I believe he did. My dad lived in San Francisco for some time, but never saw any trace of his brother. 

I have seen some stories of people finding old and lost family members, and because of the abundant access to resources, I wanted to attempt to find anything concrete. Since the family assumes he is dead, there is no worry if I find out he died. And since we have nothing besides his intent to join the Unification Church in the '70s, any information I get will be more than my family has ever had. I am asking if anyone has tips, ideas, or resources that can help in my investigation. I am unsure if the cult could have had any hand in his disappearance, as i haven't seen any claims that the cult ever withheld deaths. I was considering contacting them to see if they have any records of members that may be my uncle, but I am unsure if this is unsafe or even helpful. If the cult did have a hand in it, I doubt they would release that information. If anyone has any information on the Church of Unification that may be helpful, I would appreciate that as well! Thank you for anything, and for reading my story!"

cults,hgibpv,Is Authentic Relating/Circling a cult culture?,"I recently met for a date with somebody who had been talking a lot about these Authentic Relating classes he’s been doing. It seemed halfway kooky to me so I tried to not address it during our date, but he insisted I try an exercise with him— which was a back and forth discussion  style that seemed less substantive and more superficial than anything else. 

But I couldn’t help but notice lots of red flags with this person. Fluttering eyelids, deep shuddered breathing, living at a commune. 

Anyway, I haven’t found a whole lot about Authentic Relating/Circling that isn’t flooded with all sorts of weird lingo or very strangely oriented on blog sites. Does anyone have experience with it?"

The cult was small and from an outsiders perspective completely ridiculous. The god figure was rude, unattractive, had a raspy manic laughter, alcoholic etc. The group was brainwashed by her, deprived of sleep and sufficient food. No sex, no hard drugs.

He got kicked out of the cult for basically threatening the cult by becoming involved with police - stole and police came (small town and cult leader is smart to be on alert and no become associated with police).

Now he is at home and fully believes in the cult still. Living with him has been the hardest thing we have ever done. He is the most argumentative and draining person I’ve ever been around. I constantly have to act around him, filter what I say and avoid asking certain questions because I don’t want to trigger a rant. He has flipped on my parents and said horrible things to them. He is unhelpful around the house chronically smokes weed and drinks coffee, he drank 10-12 cups of coffee in one night starting at 8 PM once. He sleeps in the living room/kitchen instead of the room downstairs. He can be manic and his mood swings drastically. There have been a number of blowouts where he screams at my parents then cries and then leaves for hours then acts really nice after it all. We have to act in certain ways to not upset him and he literally is living in a completely different reality than us.

My parents who are genuinely amazing people are depressed and I’ve never seen my mom like this and it’s so hard. I’m going through a breakup and dealing with him and none of us are happy because of him. It is very complicated however because his true self is an amazing and very loving guy and we know he is brainwashed. Because of his past drug use it’s hard to just tell him to get out and while we are trying to have him move out there are complications there too.

He genuinely thinks the world we live in is fake and we are deeply programmed and brainwashed. Soooo looking more than anything just looking to vent and see if anyone has dealt with living with a cult member sibling or family member."
